While the findings in this study are novel, true incidence and relevance of PIK3CA mutations in this cohort require further investigation of larger numbers of BRCA1 patients, if these can be acquired for study.The alignment of PIK3CA mutation with elevated pS6 expression and absent p4EBP1 expression is different to the expected model. Theoretically, PIK3CA mutational activation of the pathway should only lead to an elevated pS6, as is seen, but not an elevated p4EBP1 (the phosphorylated form being inactive) and pAKT, which is not observed. This is in part likely to be due to the complexity of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway. Indeed, a correlation between PIK3CA mutation in luminal A FBC (the phenotype most similar to MBC) and combined up-regulation of pAKT, p4EBP1 and pS6 is not seen [55]. The association seen in the series between PIK3CA mutation and elevated pS6 (P = 0.024) may suggest partial activation of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway in MBC and reflect the variability of pS6 and p4EBP1 and pAKT levels seen in vitro with dose dependent inhibition of mTORC1 [56], or interactions of mTORC2, other pathways and feedback loops.Nevertheless, we observed up-regulation of p4EBP1 in BRCA2 mutation carriers (68.0%) more frequently than in BRCAX carriers (36.7%), an association not reported in FBC, giving further evidence to the difference in male and female breast cancers. It may be that an alternate mechanism of PIK3CA/mTOR pathway activation may be present in BRCA2 cases linked to disordered homologous recombination, as mentioned previously, through p4EBP1 and eIF4e.ConclusionThe results of this study indicate that somatic PIK3CA mutation are a frequent alteration in familial MBC of BRCAX families, the incidence and type of which is comparable to that seen in sporadic male and slightly lower than FBCs. Conversely, the absence of PIK3CA mutation in BRCA2 associated MBCs suggests that alternate oncogenic drivers minimally contribute to tumour drive in this group, thus supporting distinct male breast cancer types. The study has also revealed differences of MBC to FBC and between sporadic and familial MBC which are of importance in optimising treatment strategies and underlying relevance of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway in tumour biology. Indeed, the therapeutic implications of these findings support the delineation of significant molecular pathways, such as PIK3CA/mTOR and MAPK cascades for subsequent targeted therapies within specific populations.AbbreviationsBOADICEA: Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm; Bp: base pairs; CK: cytokeratin; DSS: disease specific survival; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; ER\xCE\xB1: estrogen receptor alpha; FBC: female breast cancer; FFPE: formalin fixed paraffin embedded; H&E: haematoxylin and eosin; HRM: high resolution melt; IC-NST: invasive carcinoma of no special type; MAPK: mitogen activated pathway kinase; MBC: male breast cancer; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORC: mammalian target of rapamycin complex; pAKT: phosphorylated AKT; PARP: poly ADP ribose polymerase; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIK3CA: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha; PgR: progesterone receptor; pS6: phosphorylated S6; p4EBP1: phosphorylated 4EBP1; SISH: silver in situ hybridization; TMA: tissue microarray; UDG: uracil DNA glycosylase.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsAD performed the manuscript review, contributed to study concept and design and the HRM assay design.

Most cases are classified as \xE2\x80\x98sporadic\xE2\x80\x99 breast carcinoma caused by genetic changes that occur over time [2], and only a small percentage (5\xE2\x80\x9310%) is of hereditary origin. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the major cause of the hereditary form of the disease. The two genes may account for less than 30% of the genetic information responsible for heritable breast cancer, indicating that other genes could have a role in hereditary tumors with no BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, the so-called non-BRCA1/2 familial tumors (BRCAx) [3], [4], [5], [6].In the last few years, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling has emerged as a useful tool to stratify tumors and pinpoint miRNAs involved in specific steps of cancer progression [7], [8], [9]. These tiny, non-coding RNAs of 18\xE2\x80\x9325 nucleotides in length, function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression by binding the 3\xE2\x80\xB2 untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs and promoting mRNA degradation or translational repression [10]. Several studies demonstrated that miRNAs can regulate the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors [11]. In breast cancer, miRNA expression profiling using microarray technology in association with some biopathological features such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status has been established as a useful tool to classify tumors [12], [13], [14], [15]. As ER, PR and HER2 are the molecular biomarkers currently used in routine clinical practice to help treatment decision in breast cancer, the identification of miRNAs whose expression could be related to their status could help to discover new molecular alterations involved in this tumor type [16].In this study, we analyzed miRNA expression profiling of a group of heredo-familial and sporadic breast cancers. The classification of the samples according to their estrogen receptor status highlighted a strong association of ER with miR-342 expression levels. Further investigations led us to study ID4, a putative target of this miRNA, and its interaction with BRCA1. After demonstrating this mechanism in an in vitro model, we hypothesized that in our cohort of cases it could be involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, in particular in BRCAx familial cases.Materials and MethodsEthics StatementThis study was approved by the Independent Ethical Committee of the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan (INT), and each patient provided written informed consent to donate the tissues left over after diagnostic procedures for research purposes.Breast Cancer SpecimensThe study analyzed fifty-two specimens from 51 patients with breast cancer; the specimens were collected at INT during the period 1983\xE2\x80\x932003. The samples included 12 sporadic breast cancers (patients with a negative family history and age of onset >40 years) and 40 specimens with familial breast cancer. For one patient that developed bilateral disease both tumors were available and analyzed. All familial patients had early onset and/or positive family history, matched criteria for BRCA1 and BRCA2 molecular analysis used at INT [17], and did not overlap with any other known hereditary cancer syndromes. All familial patients underwent genetic counseling, with pedigree reconstruction going back for at least three generations, and were offered genetic testing (see Table S1 for features of cases). Tumor specimens containing more than 80% neoplastic cells were selected by an experienced pathologist from cryopreserved samples. Table S1 summarizes the clinical and histopathological features of the analyzed samples.ER and PR status was routinely evaluated at time of diagnostic procedure according to the EORTC recommendations and within national [18] and international quality control programs by a ligand binding assay [19] and expressed as fmol mg\xE2\x88\x921 of protein. Tumors with an ER concentration higher than 10 fmol mg\xE2\x88\x921 of protein or with a PR concentration higher than 25 fmol mg\xE2\x88\x921 of protein were defined as ER-positive or PR-positive, respectively.

Studies have demonstrated key differences in spontaneous BRCA-associated tumors [2,3]. BRCA1 cancers are more likely to show a basal phenotype, with 80% to 90% of BRCA1 cancers being negative for ER and HER2 and positive for basal cytokeratins [4,5]. BRCA1 cancers also have characteristic gene-expression and genomic profiles, and appear to be sensitive to DNA damage by cisplatinum. Although reports suggest that lobular carcinomas may be more frequent in BRCA2 carriers, no specific molecular phenotype has been described for BRCA2-associated tumors, which usually show a ductal, no-special-type morphology and ER positivity [6].RAD21 is a component of the multiprotein complex cohesin, which is involved in maintaining alignment and cohesion of replicated \\\"sister\\\" chromatids. RAD21, together with SMC1, SMC3, and STAG1/2, forms a tripartite ring, which according to the \\\"ring model,\\\" promotes sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) by encircling sister chromatids [7]. SCC not only is vital for correct chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis, but also plays an important role in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). By promoting sister-chromatid alignment, cohesin allows BRCA1/2-mediated homologous recombination to occur between sister chromatids [8]. In addition to its role in maintaining sister-chromatid cohesion, evidence now suggests cohesins are involved in promoting and inhibiting gene transcription. In MCF-7 cell lines, genes cobound by cohesin and ER are preferentially regulated by estrogen [9]. Cohesin may also act as a negative regulator of gene expression, by physically blocking enhancer/promoter interaction [10].Of the four proteins that compose the core cohesin complex, RAD21 has emerged as a key marker of tumor behavior. A meta-analysis of gene-expression data from clinical cancer specimens showed that increased RAD21 expression was a feature of poorly differentiated breast, ovarian, bladder, and lung cancers [11]. Gene-expression profiling of 31 breast cancer patients with supraclavicular lymph node metastasis revealed RAD21 as one of six genes that were differentially expressed between good- and poor-outcome groups [12]. Our previous study on sporadic breast cancers showed that RAD21 overexpression correlated with early relapse in high-grade breast cancers regardless of intrinsic tumor subtype [13]. We, and others, also showed that RAD21 knockdown confers in vitro resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents, which recapitulated the findings in our cohort of sporadic breast cancers [13,14].Although RAD21 overexpression correlates with early relapse and treatment resistance in sporadic cancers, it is unclear whether familial breast cancers behave in a similar manner. This may be of particular relevance, as RAD21, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are all involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination; hence RAD21 overexpression in the absence of either BRCA1 or -2 may not necessarily confer the same predictive and prognostic implications as in sporadic cancers with intact BRCA1/2. We therefore performed an immunohistochemical analysis of RAD21 expression in a cohort of familial breast cancers. We also postulated that enhanced RAD21 expression may be associated with changes in both DNA copy number and reduced expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), and therefore correlated RAD21 expression with genomic changes and miRNAs predicted to target RAD21.Materials and methodsPatientsBreast cancer specimens were collected from a previously characterized cohort of 139 female patients from the kConFab family breast cancer registry (Table 1) [15]. Classification of BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX status was performed as described previously [15]. The flow of patients according to the REMARK guidelines (Additional file 1 Table S1) [16]. Of the 139 cases, 18 cases were excluded because of the lack of tissue available for array construction, and a further 27 cases were excluded because of the absence of tumor on the array stained for RAD21. The final cohort was composed of 94 cases, which included 28 BRCA1, 27 BRCA2, and 39 BRCAX cases. This study has ethics committee approval (Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 09/36). Consent to participate in the study and consent to publish were obtained by kConFab in accordance with its family-enrollment and data-collection guidelines [17]. Patients were followed up for a median period of 64.0 months (range, 0.4 to 299.0 months). During this time, 38 patients relapsed, and 33 died of breast cancer (deaths unrelated to breast cancer were censored). Relapse-free survival was defined as the time to first reappearance of tumor at any site after definitive treatment, whereas breast cancer-specific survival was defined as time from primary surgical excision to breast cancer-related death. All patients with HER2-positive tumors were diagnosed prior to 2000, and did not receive trastuzumab therapy.Table 1Clinical and tumor characteristicsBRCA1 n (%)BRCA2n (%)BRCAX n (%)All familialn (%)Age\xE2\x89\xA4 50 years25 (89%)15 (56%)24 (61%)64 (68%)> 50 years3 (11%)12 (44%)15 (39%)30 (32%)Tumor size< 20 mm20 (71%)13 (52%)16 (47%)49 (56%)> 20 mm8 (29%)12 (48%)18 (53%)38 (44%)Unknown0257Nodal statusNegative26 (93%)19 (70%)25 (64%)70 (74%)Positive2 (7%)8 (30%)14 (36%)24 (26%)Unknown0000GradeI01 (4%)2 (6%)3 (4%)II2 (9%)10 (44%)8 (24%)20 (25%)III21 (93%)12 (52%)23 (70%)56 (71%)Unknown54615ER\xCE\xB1Negative23 (85%)5 (21%)11 (32%)39 (46%)Positive4 (15%)19 (79%)23 (68%)46 (54%)Unknown1359PgRNegative23 (85%)9 (38%)16 (47%)48 (56%)Positive4 (15%)15 (62%)18 (53%)37 (44%)Unknown1359HER2 statusNegative26 (100%)22 (100%)28 (85%)76 (94%)Positive005 (15%)5 (6%)Unknown25613Endocrine therapyNot given22 (96%)16 (76%)21 (64%)59 (77%)Given1 (4%)5 (24%)12 (36%)18 (23%)Unknown56617ChemotherapyNot given8 (30%)15 (60%)13 (39%)16 (42%)Given19 (70%)10 (40%)20 (61%)49 (58%)Unknown1269n = 94.ImmunohistochemistryTumor-tissue microarrays (1-mm cores), with a twofold redundancy, were prepared from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. RAD21 staining was performed as previously described by using a rabbit polyclonal anti-RAD21 antibody (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) [13]. Nuclear RAD21 expression was assessed for intensity (0, no staining; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong) and the percentage of positive cells (0, 0; 1, < 10%; 2, 10% to 50%; 3, 51% to 80%; 4, > 80% positive cells). The scores for intensity and percentage were added, and a cut-off of 6, the median, was used to define two approximately equal sized groups of patients (with low and high RAD21 expression) for subsequent statistical analyses [13].HER2 chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and immunoperoxidase staining for ER\xCE\xB1, PgR, HER2, CK5/6, and EGFR were performed for all tumors. By using stratification of intrinsic phenotypes based on Nielsen et al. [18], we placed tumors into luminal (ER positive, HER2 negative, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 negative or positive), basal (HER2 and ER negative; CK5/6 positive), HER2 (HER2 positive, ER and CK5/6 negative or positive), and null/negative (HER2, ER, and CK5/6 negative). For HER2, EGFR, and CK5/6, the cut-offs were derived from Neilsen et al. [18]. An Allred score of > 2/8 was considered positive for ER\xCE\xB1 [19].Gene-expression and copy-number analysis of RAD21 Gene-expression and copy-number variation (CNV) data from a cohort of familial breast cancers were derived from a previous study, by using the Illumina Human-6 BeadArray (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the CNV370 SNP array (Illumina), respectively [20]. In this study, the familial tumors were classified into one of the breast tumor subtypes: basal-like, luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and normal-like. These data were used to determine the expression of RAD21 in 75 (19 BRCA1, 30 BRCA2, 25 BRCAX, one unknown) familial breast cancers. Of these 75 cases, 34 had matching CNV data available (11 BRCA1, nine BRCA2, and 14 BRCAX), and 18 had matching protein-expression data as assessed by immunohistochemistry (seven BRCA1, eight BRCA2, three BRCAX). Copy number was determined by using SNP-CGH data for 34 tumors. All data were imported and visualized in Beadstudio v3.2. The logR ratio was used to perform frequency plots of genomic gain or loss by using CGH explorer [21]. R was used to perform SOMATICS [22] to identify regions containing genomic aberrations. The copy number of RAD21 in each tumor was inferred from the average logR value of 22 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were within the RAD21 intron (n = 2) or in sequences flanking the gene (n = 20). All these data are available on GEO (Accession Number GSE19177).microRNA and gene-expression data miningMatching gene-expression and miRNA profiles o

Cells were tested and authenticated using the StemElite ID System (Promega). Each cell line was grown in a specific medium: BT20 in DMEM +10% fetal bovine serum; MDA-MB-231 in RPMI +5% fetal bovine serum; HCC1937 in RPMI +15% fetal bovine serum; MCF7 in MEM +10% fetal bovine insulin +0.01 mg/ml+1% NEAA (MEM Non Essential Amminoacids) +1% Sodium Pyruvate; T47D in DMEM +10% fetal bovine serum; 293T in DMEM +10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were maintained as a monolayer in a humidified incubator at 37\xC2\xB0C with a supply of 5% CO2.miRNA Expression AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted from tissue samples using Trizol (Life Technologies) and DNase I treated (Quiagen) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s protocol.MicroRNA microarray profiling was performed for the 52 samples as described in [11], [20]. Briefly, 5 \xC2\xB5g of total RNA was labeled and hybridized to each microRNA microarray containing 368 probes, including 245 human and mouse miRNA genes, in triplicate. Scanner images were quantified by the Quantarray software (Perkin-Elmer). Poor signal quality of background-corrected intensities were flagged and removed from the analysis, all intensities below 200 were thresholded to the value of 200; the expression values were log2 transformed and a Lowess normalization [21] was applied to each slide, using the internal replicates for the normalization. The normalized log2-tranformed expression ratios (sample/reference) of each miRNA were averaged and the arrays were median centered. Only human miRNAs (hsa-miR) were used for further analyses. The miRNA data sets were filtered by removing miRNAs with more than 50% missing (invalid) values. MiRNAs expression data have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE46966.Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)The RNA expressions of ESR1, PGR, ERBB2, BRCA1 and ID4 were measured by qRT-PCR on 1 \xC2\xB5g of the same RNA used for miRNA analysis and on 1 \xC2\xB5g of RNA extracted from the breast cancer cell lines with the same procedures used for the tissue specimens. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit and TaqMan reactions were performed in duplicate using TaqMan Assays-on-Demand Gene Expression Products (ESR1 Hs00174860_m1, PgRHs00172183_m1, HER2 Hs00170433_m1, ID4 Hs00155465_m1, BRCA1 Hs00173233_m1, Applied Biosystems). For miR-342 expression analysis, 30 ng of total RNA in a final volume of 15 \xC2\xB5L was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit and miR-342 specific primers (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions. RT-qPCR was conducted using FAST chemistry (Applied Biosystems) in ABI PRISM 7700 and 7900 HT Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). To normalize data, 18S ribosomal subunit and GAPDH were used as housekeeping (4319413E, Hs99999905_m1, Applied Biosystems). The expression values of the miR-342 (002260) were normalized to RNU6B (001093). Data analysis was performed using the Sequence Detector v1.9 software.Identification of miRNAs Associated with Estrogen, Progesterone and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Expression and StatusIn order to identify the miRNAs associated with the estrogen receptor we fitted a linear regression model of each miRNA, using the normalized intensity of the miRNA as the outcome and the (log2-transformed) ESR1 expression (measured using qRT-PCR) as a covariate; similarly, we used the estrogen receptor status (ER-positive or ER-negative) as a covariate to identify the miRNAs associated with the ER status. We identified the miRNAs associated with progesterone and epidermal growth factor 2 receptors expression/status using similar models. The associations were considered statistically significant if the P values were less than 0.01.To adjust the analysis for the presence of a possible batch effect in the miRNA experiment, all miRNA analyses were adjusted to the day on which the experiment was performed.Evaluation of the Association of BRCA1 with Genes Involved in Breast Cancer (ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1) and miR-342Using patients\xE2\x80\x99 samples, we examined the association of BRCA1 gene expression with the expression of ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1 and miR-342. The association was assessed fitting a multivariable linear regression model in which BRCA1 expression was the outcome variable and the expression of the genes and of miR-342 were the covariates; we also included an interaction term between the ER status and miR-342. The expression of the genes was evaluated using qRT-PCR, while the expression of miR-342 was measured on the miRNA arrays.Independent Case Series Used to Validate the ResultsPublicly available data on mRNA and miRNA expression of breast cancers were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [22].mRNA expression levels of BRCA1, ID4, ESR1, PGR and ERBB2, as well as ER and PR status, were available for 526 breast cancer patients; for 288 of them miR-342 expression was also available. Fifteen patients were BRCA1-mutant (12/15 with ER-positive status) and 22 were BRCA2-mutant (15/21 with ER-positive status). Family history of patients was not available, therefore all the other samples were classified as sporadics (384/485). Twenty two out of the 228 patients for which the information was available had an amplification of ERBB2.Computational AspectsAll the analyses were performed using BRB-ArrayTools v3.1 developed by Dr Richard Simon and Amy Peng Lam and R language for statistical computing (Development Core Team (2009).

Subsequently, 0.1 \xC2\xB5g of the pLuc ID4 3\xE2\x80\xB2 UTR construct together with 0.01 \xC2\xB5g of Renilla luciferase pRLTK plasmid (Promega) were cotransfected with 100 nM of pre-miR-342 (mature sequence: UCUCACACAGAAAUCGCACCCGU, ID:PM12328) or pre-miR-1 (mature sequence: UGGAAUGUAAAGAAGUAUGUAU, ID: PM10617) or with pre-miR negative control#1 (Pre-miR-TM miRNA Precursor Molecule, Negative Control #1, ID: AM17110; Ambion) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions. After 24 hours, the luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla activity to control the transfection efficiency.Transfection of miR-342 and miR Negative Control Precursor MoleculesThe day before transfection, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells were seeded at a density of 25\xC3\x97104 in 60-mm dishes. Pre-miR-342 precursor molecule and pre-miR negative control#1 (scramble) were transfected at a final concentration of 100 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions. MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of 35\xC3\x97104 in 60-mm dishes and transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions.ID4 SilencingMDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a siRNA pool of four oligonucleotides (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool) targeting different portions of ID4 gene (ThermoScientific Dharmacon), at a final concentration of 25 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 24 hours these cells were transfected with 100 nM of pre-miR-342 precursor molecule and collected 48 hours after the second transfection for RNA extraction and protein lysates.Western BlottingWestern blots were carried out for ID4 and BRCA1 protein. Seventy two hours after transfection with miR-342 precursor or negative control, MDA-MB-231, HCC1937 and MCF7 cells were collected by trypsinization and resuspended in 300 ul of 1X SDS sample buffer (62.5 Mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM DTT), supplemented with protease inhibitors cocktail (Calbiochem).Protein quantification was performed using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Forty micrograms of protein extract were loaded on 7% to 15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-ID4 (82-12, dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB61000, Calbioreagents), anti-BRCA1 (dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB6800, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-\xCE\xB2-Actin (dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB65000, MP Biomedicals), anti-Vinculin (dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB65000, Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-\xCE\xB1-Tubulin (dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB65000, Sigma-Aldrich). Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Scientific).Protein level quantification was performed using the software Imagelab\xC2\xA9, by subtracting the global background of each membrane from the volume of intensity of the antibody detection bands (rectangle enco

The level of a protein in a certain sample was measured as the ratio between the quantifications of the band for the specific-antibody and the band for loading control.ResultsmiRNAs Expression Profile AnalysisWe obtained the miRNA profiles of 52 breast cancer tumors through hybridization on a custom microarray platform already validated by numerous studies [11]. The 52 samples included 15 positive cases for mutations of BRCA1 gene (BRCA1-mutant cases), 10 positive cases for mutations of BRCA2 gene (BRCA2-mutant cases), 15 cases with evidence of hereditary predisposition to breast cancer but without pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (BRCAx cases) and 12 cases not eligible for BRCA testing and with negative familial history (sporadic cases). Their main characteristics are reported in Table S1.We evaluated the association of the miRNA profiles with estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptors, measured both at mRNA expression levels (defined as ESR1, PGR and ERBB2), obtained by qRT-PCR, and at protein levels (defined as ER, PR and HER2) and classified positive or negative (status) as described in materials and methods. Regarding mRNA expression, we identified 22 miRNAs significantly associated to ESR1, 12 miRNAs associated to PGR and 11 related to ERBB2 levels (P<0.05). Dividing samples according to their protein levels for the three studied markers (status), 14 miRNAs were associated to ER, 5 to PR and 4 to HER2 status (P<0.05) (Table S2 and Figure S1).miR-342 had the strongest positive correlation with ESR1 expression (Pearson correlation r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.5, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.0001, Figure 1A) and had the biggest average difference between patients with ER-positive status and those with ER-negative status (Figure 1B and Figure S1). We estimated that patients with ER-positive status had on average 2.1 times higher miR-342 expression compared to patients with ER-negative status (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.0002, two-sample t-test, Figure 1B). A very similar association between ER and miR-342 was observed on the TCGA data set (Figure S2).10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g001Figure 1miR-342 expression in patients according to ESR1 expression levels or ER status.(A) Positive correlation of log2 normalized expression of miR-342 detected on miRNA arrays and log2 transformed ESR1 levels measured by qRT-PCR in the patients analyzed. The dashed line was obtained using a linear regression model. (B) Box plot representation of miR-342 expression according to estrogen receptor negative or positive status of the patients analyzed.miR-342 Directly Targets ID4In three public databases for miRNA targets prediction (microRNA.org, release August 2010; TargetScan 6.2 and PicTar, release March 2007), we searched for putative 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR gene targets of miR-342. We focused on the ID4 gene that was a predicted target of miR-342 in all the three databases. ID4 belongs to a family of dominant negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and is highly expressed in diverse cancer types, including breast cancer [23]. The expression of this gene has also been found inversely correlated with that of ER status [24].We evaluated the expression levels of ID4 in our cohort of patients by qRT-PCR. We confirmed a negative correlation between ID4 and ESR1 expression (r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A\xE2\x88\x920.62, P<0.0001) and found that ER-positive patients on average had three times smaller ID4 expression compared to ER-negative patients (95% CI: 1.6 to 5.8, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.002) (Figure 2). In our samples, miR-342 and ID4 had opposite expression compared to estrogen receptor, suggesting an interplay among them. In fact, a negative correlation between miR-342 array and ID4 expression data was observed in our cohort of cases (r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A\xE2\x88\x920.44, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.002) (Figure 3). Association of ID4, ESR1 and miR-342 was very similar also in the TCGA data set (Figures S3 and S4).10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g002Figure 2ID4 expression in patients according to ESR1 expression levels or ER status.(A) Negative correlation of ID4 expression and ESR1 levels both measured by qRT-PCR analysis. The dashed line was obtained using a linear regression model.

Samples are represented according to their positive/negative estrogen receptor status. The dashed line was obtained using a linear regression model.In our data the association between ID4 and miR-342 was attenuated when the analysis was adjusted for ESR1 expression: in the linear regression models with ID4 used as a dependent variable, the regression coefficient of miR-342 was \xE2\x88\x920.69 (95% CI: \xE2\x88\x921.1 to \xE2\x88\x920.27, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.002) in the univariable model, and \xE2\x88\x920.31 (95% CI: \xE2\x88\x920.71 to 0.10, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.12) in the model adjusted for the expression of ESR1. A similar result was observed also in the TCGA data set, where the association between ID4 and miR-342 was attenuated but it remained statistically significant in the ESR1 adjusted analysis (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.008, regression coefficients \xE2\x88\x920.35 and \xE2\x88\x920.16 in univariable and adjusted analysis, respectively). To functionally validate miR-342 binding to the 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR of the ID4 gene and its potential inhibitory effect on this gene, an in vitro model was constructed using a reporter luciferase system. The resulting vector, pLuc ID4-3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR, contained the 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR region of ID4 gene with the predicted miR-342 binding site downstream the Luciferase gene (Figure 4A). pLuc ID4-3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR vector was cotransfected in 293T cells either with miR-342 precursor molecule, another precursor molecule containing a seed region that does not bind to ID4 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR (miR-1) or a scramble oligonucleotide. Sequences of miR-1 used as aspecific miRNA and of the scramble oligonucleotide were both used as negative controls. As shown in Figure 4B, miR-342 overexpression significantly decreased the luciferase activity compared to the scramble oligonucleotide (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.002). By contrast, transfection of pLuc ID4-3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR construct with miR-1 precursor, which has no predicted binding sites for ID4 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR, prevented the down-regulation of luciferase expression. This result indicated that the reduction of luciferase activity was miR-342 specific and that there was a direct interaction between miR-342 and ID4 gene.10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g004Figure 4miR-342 directly regulates ID4.(A) The 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR of ID4 gene containing the predicted miR-342 binding site was cloned into pGL3-promoter vector. This construct was cotransfected with precursor molecules of miR-342 or of miR-1 (whose seed region has no affinity for ID4 3\xE2\x80\xB2 UTR). (B) Relative luciferase activity in 293T cells was determined after transfection. A scramble oligonucleotide was used as negative control of transfection.Correlation between ID4 and BRCA1 Expression through miR-342As ID4 can regulate the transcription of BRCA1 [25], we investigated a possible association between the expression levels of these two genes in our cohort of patients. Using a qRT-PCR approach, we observed a negative correlation between ID4 and BRCA1 gene expression (r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A\xE2\x88\x920.26, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.07) in our case series (Figure 5A). A similar negative correlation was observed also in the TCGA data set (r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A\xE2\x88\x920.28, P<0.0001, Figure S5A). Classification of samples according to their sporadic or heredo-familial status (BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutant and BRCAx) showed a different trend of expression of the two genes. BRCA1-mutant and BRCAx cases had higher expression of ID4 and lower expression of BRCA1 compared to sporadic and BRCA2-mutant samples (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.07, Figure 5B). We observed a similar pattern also in the TCGA data set (Figure S5B, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.0013).10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g005Figure 5Expression of ID4 and BRCA1 in patients.(A) Negative correlation of ID4 expression and BRCA1 levels both measured by qRT-PCR analysis. The dashed line was obtained using a linear regression model. (B) Differences between delta Ct values of ID4 and BRCA1 in patients divided into hereditary (BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutant), familial (BRCAx) or sporadic groups.Having showed that ID4 is a direct target of miR-342, we hypothesized that modulation of ID4 operated by miR-342 could provide a mechanism for regulating BRCA1 expression.To asses in an in vitro model of breast cancer the miRNA-target interaction and its effect on BRCA1, expression levels of ID4 and miR-342 were measured in five human breast cancer cell lines including MDA-MB-231 and BT20 (ER-negative), HCC1937 (BRCA1-mutant, ER-negative) [26], MCF7 and T47D (ER-positive). As shown in Figure 6A, an inverse correlation of ID4 and the miRNA was observed; in particular ID4 gene expression was higher in the ER-negative cell lines. By contrast, miR-342 had higher expression in ER-positive cells. This was in accordance with literature data that report both ID4 and miR-342 expression associated with the ER status of human breast cancer cells [13], [24], [27].10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g006Figure 6Down-regulation of ID4 protein through miR-342 increases BRCA1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells.(A) Expression of ID4 (left) and miR-342 (right) measured by qRT-PCR in five breast cancer cell lines.

We identified a PIK3CA mutation rate of 10.5% in familial MBCs but an absence of common activating mutations of AKT1, KRAS and BRAF. While limited by moderate numbers in our study, the absence of KRAS mutation contrasts with the only other study performed in sporadic MBCs by Dawson et al. who reported an overall incidence of 12% [20]. Methodological reasons may be underlying these difference but in our experience, HRM is a highly sensitive and robust technique [42,43]. The absence of BRAF mutation is also somewhat expected and is supported by the stronger association between basal cell breast cancer lines and BRAF mutation [44] (since the majority of MBCs are of a luminal subtype). While a true frequency of these mutations requires further testing in a much larger cohort, these data suggest frequency is unlikely to be high and should parallel the range (0.7 to 5%) that is observed in female breast cancer.The mutation rate of PIK3CA in this series is lower than the reported 17.9% (7/39) in the only other study performed, although this was in a population-based cohort of MBCs patients [19]. It is also less frequent than that reported in FBC (16.3% [19] to 40.0% [3]) (Table 4), which supports the notion that male breast cancer is biologically different from female breast cancer and that therapies that rely on the experience of the female disease are likely to be suboptimal. Furthermore, evidence from our data demonstrating that differences in this PIK3CA/mTOR pathway is dependent on the germline genotypes of male breast cancer, shows the basis of male breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers is very different to that of BRCAX giving further credence to personalising breast cancer treatment whether male or female using individual patient and tumour characteristics. Thus, as the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in tumours from in BRCA2 carriers is likely to be negligible, these patients are unlikely to derive benefits from the PIK3CA inhibitors that are now entering clinical trials for female breast cancer [19].Table 4Comparison of PIK3CA mutation studies in male and female breast cancerMale Breast CancerFemale Breast CancerCurrent StudyBenvenuti S et al.

(Table 4) showed exclusively exon 20 mutations in MBC, supporting the suggestion that the frequency of exon 9 and 20 mutations may be gender and tissue specific. We, however, noted an equal distribution of exon 9 and 20 mutations, which is more reflective of the distribution seen by others in FBC [3,14]. Furthermore, the E547K mutation noted in two of our BRCAX patients has only once previously been reported in a single female breast cancer suggestive of a unique hot spot preferentially within male cancers. This mutation was detected and confirmed using HRM and Sanger sequencing in duplicate for each case using methodologies optimised for FFPE material. We have extensive experience with this methodology and feel it to be well suited and robust for formalin fixed paraffin embedded material. While we also acknowledge the occurrence of artifactual changes, the E547K mutation has not been detected in over 300 FFPE tumour samples we have screened to date (unpublished data) and thus, we feel that this mutation may be particular to a subset of MBC. The E547K mutation itself is found in the highly conserved helical domain of PIK3CA and possibly confers increased catalytic activity. The mutation is not unique to breast cancer, and has also been reported previously in one colorectal adenocarcinoma [45] and in seven neuroendocrine tumours of the lung [46] lending support for a true pathogenic mutation. Targeted sequencing of further MBC, and in particular non-BRCA2 tumours, may help determine a more accurate incidence and potential relevance of this uncommon mutation. We also observed a case with two concurrent exon 9 mutations, which has not been previously reported in MBC. While there is some suggestion of a more aggressive phenotype or of tumour heterogeneity in cases with dual PIK3CA mutations [16,47,48], the clinical significance of this is also unclear due to the infrequency of this observation.Recent data show that BRCA2 appears to be a significant driver in MBC, with a considerably higher penetrance within male BRCA2 carriers compared with males in BRCAX families and BRCA1 male mutation carriers [1]. It is also noteworthy that BRCA2 somatic mutations have also been reported in 21.8% of sporadic MBCs [22]. Furthermore, unlike in FBC, studies by Ottini et al. [49] and ourselves [1] intimate a distinct BRCA2 phenotype in MBCs, which more commonly contain areas of micropapillary histology, are of a higher grade, are PgR negative and are HER2 amplified. The genomic findings of this study emphasize that BRCA2 tumours may be a distinct subgroup in familial MBC and as such BRCA2 mutation may be a significant driver in MBC. Further support for a strong inherent BRCA2 associated drive independent of gender and estrogenic influence in male breast cancer is the association of PIK3CA mutation and ER\xCE\xB1 positive female breast cancer [14-17], a phenotype which is common to BRCA2 associated male tumours (92%) [1], but without the associated rate of PIK3CA mutation. These data suggest that gender and hormonal dimorphism may not be so significant in BRCA2 carriers and that BRCA2 male breast cancers align with the non-PIK3CA mutated ER\xCE\xB1 positive group of female breast cancer.PIK3CA oncogenic drive, however, may be more important in non-BRCA2 MBCs where estrogenic influences may be more prominent. While our previous studies have shown that ER\xCE\xB1 and PgR positive tumours were seen at a similar frequency across all BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRCAX cohorts and more commonly than in FBC [1], based on this genotypic analysis, the mechanism and effect of PIK3CA mutation is likely to be different between the subgroups. Overall, given the association between ER\xCE\xB1 positive tumours and increased PIK3CA mutation frequency in FBC, one would assume an increased rate of PIK3CA mutation in MBCs. This is not seen and may suggest alternate receptor and PIK3CA/mTOR interaction in male breast cancer or a dose-based relationship differentiated by male cancers with low estrogen at one end of the spectrum and higher levels of estrogen in females at the opposite end. While studies have extensively examined the correlation between hormone receptor status and incidence of PIK3CA mutation, as yet there are very limited data on the effect of circulating oestradiol on PIK3CA mutation rate with some suggestion that PIK3CA/mTOR activation may contribute to tamoxifen-resistance. Further evidence of estrogen influence is also provided by Benvenuti et al. who observed a gender bias for PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer with a higher incidence of mutations in women (23%) compared with men (9%) [19] (Table 4), which reflect the findings of our study. Further study correlating serum oestradiol, testosterone levels and PIK3CA mutation frequency in MBCs are required to further elaborate on a possible association.Recent in vitro studies showing increased sensitization of cancers with defects in DNA homologous recombination (as seen in BRCA1/2 deficient cancers), to PARP inhibition by targeting of PIK3CA [18,50] suggest that PIK3CA/mTOR pathway interactions result in homologous recombination steady state. Support for the model is not yet seen in vivo with only one study to date to have examined a correlation between BRCA mutation carriers' status and PIK3CA mutation incidence in FBC. Limited by numbers, Michelucci et al. describe two mutations (one codon 9 and one codon 20) in 12 BRCA2 mutation carriers and no mutations in 10 BRCA1 mutation carriers [15]. The clinical value of this dual targeting is unknown in BRCA1/2 FBCs and whether it is male or female, this study is also the first to describe a PIK3CA somatic mutation in a BRCA1 mutation carrier. The low numbers of MBCs in BRCA1 mutation carriers in our study reflects the paucity of these tumours in this particular cohort, and in BRCA1 carriers in general [51-54]. What is apparent is that BRCA1-associated tumours in males appear to be more similar to the tumours seen in post-menopausal female BRCA1 carriers, with an absence of tumours arising in young patients and an absence of an association with basal cell phenotype. Notwithstanding, carrying a BRCA1 mutation does appears to be a risk factor for MBC with a higher incidence than that of the general population but at much lower penetrance than s

(C) Western blotting analysis of ID4 and BRCA1 proteins on the same cells. qRT-PCR data are expressed as two elevated to \xE2\x80\x93\xCE\x94Ct (delta cycle threshold) value which is directly related to the expression levels. \xCE\xB2-Actin and Vinculin were used as loading control.Among the five cell lines analyzed for ID4 and miR-342 expression, we selected MDA-MB-231(ER-negative), HCC1937 (BRCA1-mutant and ER-negative) and MCF7 (ER-positive) cells and transfected them with miR-342 precursor molecule, or with a scramble oligonucleotide, to assess the expression modulation of ID4 and BRCA1 proteins through Western blotting analysis. Overexpression of miR-342, verified in all the three cell lines by qRT-PCR (Figure 6B), led to a reduction of 60% of ID4 protein and to an increase of about 50% of BRCA1 protein in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to cells transfected with a scramble oligonucleotide (Figure 6C) thus confirming that miR-342 can indirectly modulate BRCA1 expression. Reduction of ID4 protein (about 50%) was observed also in HCC1937 cells, which carry both the BRCA1 truncated alleles, but it was not associated with increase of BRCA1 protein. In the MCF7 cells the weak reduction of ID4 protein observed (about 20%) did not lead to an increase of BRCA1 protein (Figure 6C).MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with a pool of four oligonucleotides targeting different portions of ID4 (siRNA ID4) that silenced ID4 expression showed increased expression of BRCA1 that was similar to that observed after miR-342 overexpression; this effect was stronger when cells were cotransfected with siRNA ID4 and miR-342 (Figure 7).10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g007Figure 7Silencing of ID4 in MDA-MB-231 cells.Transfection of siRNA ID4 and pre-miR-342 or of a scramble oligonucleotide in MDA-MB-231 cells: (A) qRT-PCR evaluation of miR-342 expression.

To this aim, we assessed if the association of ID4 and miR-342 with BRCA1 was independent from ESR1, PGR and ERBB2. We fitted a multivariable linear regression model in which the BRCA1 gene expression was modelled as a function of ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1 and miR-342; an interaction between ER status and miR-342 expression was also included (adjusted analysis) while the other interaction terms were not statistically significant and were not included. The results were also compared to those obtained using models with only one covariate included (univariariate analysis) as graphically presented in Figure 8. After adjusting the analysis for all the other variables included in the model, statistically there was no significant association between BRCA1 and ID4 (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.60) or PGR (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.16), while an association between BRCA1 and ERBB2 was observed (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.007). The expression of BRCA1 and ESR1 was significantly and positively associated in the group of the ER-positive samples (P<0.001), but not in the group of the ER-negative samples (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.21), even though, on average, the ER-negative and ER-positive samples had similar BRCA1 expression. miR-342 was positively associated to the BRCA1 gene within the subset of ER-negative patients (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.02), while the association was not statistically significant for ER-positive patients (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.26). This finding suggests the existence of a mechanism different from ER status that regulates BRCA1 expression in ER-negative samples that could be operated through expression of miR-342.10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g008Figure 8Estimated association between BRCA1 and ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1 and miR-342.The associations were estimated from regression models where BRCA1 was the outcome (y-axis) while the other genes (ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1) and miR-342 were the covariates (x-axis). In the multivariate model (adjusted analysis, showed in solid lines) all the covariates and the interaction terms between ER status and miR-342 were included. The univariate models (showed in dashed lines) included only the specified gene (ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1) or miR-342 as covariates. The analysis of the association of BRCA1 with ER and miR-342 was done dividing patients according to their ER status.Estimating the same model with the TCGA data set we found that ID4 remained statistically significantly associated to BRCA1 in the analysis adjusted for all the other variables (P<0.001), while the positive association between ESR1 and BRCA1 within the ER-positive patients, observed in the univariable analysis, was not statistically significant in the adjusted analysis. The positive association between miR-342 and BRCA1 within the ER-negative patients, observed in the model based on our data, was not confirmed on the TCGA data set (see Figure S6 for complete results).DiscussionIn this study we demonstrated in vitro that a mechanism involving the microRNA miR-342 and the two genes ID4 and BRCA1, which are frequently altered in breast cancer, could have a role in the pathogenesis of this tumor type. We showed in the ER-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 that miR-342 indirectly controls the expression of BRCA1 gene through direct regulation of ID4. This result was supported by the finding that, using a siRNA based strategy to reduce ID4 expression, we observed increased expression of BRCA1, comparable to that found with miR-342 transfection.miR-342 is expressed in several cancers including leukemia [28], breast and colorectal cancer, where it exerts a tumor suppressor function that is operated through induction of apoptosis [29], [30]. In breast cancer, expression of miR-342 has been associated with better prognosis [15], [31]. This finding is supported by the observation that miR-342 is highly expressed in ER-positive tumors, in particular in the luminal molecular subclass of breast cancers [13], [14] characterized by better prognosis, and that its expression is directly correlated with the expression levels of the estrogen receptor [14], [32], [33]. In addition, miR-342 is down-regulated in breast tumors resistant to Tamoxifen, a selective ER modulator commonly used for treating ER-positive breast cancers. Reintroduction of miR-342 sensitizes refractory breast tumor cells to tamoxifen therapy, suggesting that miR-342 is an important regulator of tamoxifen response [34], [35]. In our cohort of breast cancer cases and in five breast cancer cell lines, as well as in an independent in silico data set of 283 breast cancer retrieved from TCGA [22], we confirmed the strong positive association between miR-342 expression and ER status, as miR-342 was more highly expressed in ER-positive than in ER-negative cases and cell lines. In order to identify the genes controlled by miR-342 that could be involved in breast cancer, thus underlining the role of miR-342 in this tumor type, we used a computational approach for predicting miRNA target transcripts and identified ID4 as a putative target of miR-342 in all the three databases of miRNA target prediction we investigated. ID4 is a member of the ID (inhibitor of DNA binding) family of the helix-loop-helix-transcription factors (HLH) that do not possess a DNA binding domain. ID proteins function as dominant-negative regulators of basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors through the formation of inactive heterodimers [36]. The four members of the ID proteins family (ID-1 to 4) are regulators of crucial cellular processes. Increased expression of ID proteins has been reported in several cancer types [37], [38], [39] and has been found associated with loss of differentiation, enhanced malignancy and aggressive clinical behavior [36], [40]. ID4 is involved in mammalian embryogenesis, angiogenesis and in the maintenance of cancer stem cells [41], [42], [43]. In breast cancer, ID4 expression is quite controversial; in fact, it was found in normal breast epithelium, and, while it was not detected in ER-positive tumors or neoplastic lesions [24], it was present in ER-negative tumors [27]. Beger and colleagues showed that an increase in ID4 expression was associated with the ability of breast cancer cells to exhibit anchorage-independent growth, while its depletion determined their morphological change to large and flat epithelial phenotypes [25]. The finding that ID4 is a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 [25], [27], [44] supports an oncogenic function of ID4. Germline mutations of BRCA1 predispose to breast cancer and are characteristic of the hereditary form of this tumor [6]. Somatic mutations in this gene are very rare in the sporadic form, while decreased expression levels of BRCA1 have been identified in the triple negative group, or basal-like subtype, of sporadic breast cancers (ER, PR and HER2 negative) that have genetic profiles similar to BRCA1 mutation carrier tumors [44] and express high levels of ID4 [45]. We confirmed that ID4 expression is inversely correlated to ER levels and observed an inverse correlation between ID4 and expression of miR-342 in our cohort of cases, in the independent data set and in the breast cancer cell lines we analyzed, which supported the interaction between miR-342 and ID4 predicted in silico. Finally, our in vitro experiments conduct

In several studies, the presence of a p53 mutation was the single, most powerful prognostic indicator for both recurrence and death. Whether the prognostic significance of all types of mutations is the same, is still controversial. Borresen et al103 reported that patients with mutations affecting or disrupting the zinc-binding domains L2 and L3 (p53 codons 163\xE2\x80\x93195 and 236\xE2\x80\x93251) have a worse prognosis than patients with mutations elsewhere. In a later study, mutations affecting amino acids directly involved in DNA-binding\xE2\x80\x94many in the zinc binding domain\xE2\x80\x94were related with the poorest prognosis.104 These findings were confirmed in a different study, where patients with missense mutations affecting DNA-binding or zinc-binding domains had a very aggressive phenotype with a short survival.105 Another group reported that the prognosis for mutations in the conserved regions II and V was worse than for mutations in the conserved regions III and IV and non-conserved regions.106 The poor prognosis for patients with specific p53 mutations could mean that they have a gain-of-function effect or a particularly strong dominant-negative phenotype.107Recent reports have described the detection of tumor-specific DNA circulating in plasma from breast cancer patients. Garcia et al108 examined plasma DNA from the breast cancer patients; in 61 of the 142 patients, with an average 58 months of follow-up, similar molecular signatures in tumor and plasma DNA was detected. For patients with tumor DNA in their plasma, the hazard ratio for recurrence was 2.5. Disease-free survival was 37% for positive patients and 75% for negative patients (P = 0.005). Among the 35 recurrences observed, 25 were positive for tumor plasma DNA and 10 were negative, (P < 0.001). These results indicate that tumor plasma DNA at diagnosis can serve as a prognostic marker of the overall survival of breast cancer patients. Further work is required to determine the role of the p53 mutations in plasma DNA in breast cancer prognosis.Although both HER2 overexpression and p53 mutations are important prognostic factors for breast cancer, only a few reports have described the signaling cascades that link HER2 and p53. It was reported that HER2 overexpression in p53 wild-type human ovarian carcinoma cell line induced apoptosis shortly after transfection, while HER2 expression was associated with proliferation in cells with mutated p53.109 It was also reported that HER2/neu induces p53 ubiquitination via Akt-mediated Mdm2 phosphorylation and inactivates p53 in Arf-deficient cells.110 Thus, both ARF and p53 are important genetic determinants in susceptibility to HER2 overexpression in breast cancer. Further experiments should be conducted to characterize the signaling pathway between HER2 and ARF/p53.ARFThe INK4a/ARF locus encodes two unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, which participate in the two main cell-cycle control pathways, p16INK4a-Rb and p14ARF-p53111\xE2\x80\x93115 (Fig. 1). p14ARF (p19Arf in mice), is a 14 kDa (19 kDa) protein predominantly localized in the nucleolus. It blocks the cell cycle in both G1 and G2 phases and inhibits the growth of incipient cancer cells by indirectly activating p53. It also inhibits ribosomal RNA processing and interacts with topoisomerase I.116 Arf triggers sumoylation of many cellular proteins, including Mdm2 and nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), with which p19Arf physically interacts in vivo. This occurs equally well in cells expressing or lacking functional p53.117 Thus, Arf\xE2\x80\x99s p53-independent effects on gene expression and tumor suppression might depend on Arf-induced sumoylation.117Methylation of CpG promoter islands has been described as a mechanism of gene silencing. Exon 1 of the p16INK4a gene and the p14ARF promoter gene reside within CpG islands. Therefore, both can become methylated de novo and silenced. However, genetic alterations that selectively inactivate p14ARF have been poorly analyzed in breast cancer. One comprehensive analysis of the inactivation mechanisms (mutation, homozygous and hemizygous deletion, and promoter hypermethylation) in 100 primary breast carcinomas118,119 used RT-PCR to document variable expression of the p14ARF transcript, with 17% demonstrating overexpression and 26% demonstrating decreased expression. No detectable alterations were observed in most cases with overexpressed p14ARF mRNA, but 77% of tumors with decreased expression had at least one of these genetic/epigenetic alterations. A different group analyzed the methylation status of p16INK4a and p14ARF by methylation-specific PCR in 100 breast, 95 colon and 27 bladder carcinomas. 120 Clinicopathological parameters were obtained from the medical records of the patients, and p14ARF showed a higher rate of hypermethylation than p16INK4a in all three tumor types.120 Sharma et al also found promoter hypermethylation of p14ARF in serum and tumor DNA from breast cancer patients. Aberrant methylation was significantly correlated with poor prognosis when analyzed with clinicopathological parameters of the breast tumor subtypes.121 Thus, both p16INK4a and p14ARF hypermethylation may be useful markers to predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients.TBX2/3T-box proteins contain a T-domain that affects dimerization and DNA binding. TBX2 belongs to the Tbx subfamily of T-box transcription factors.122,123 Other subfamilies of T-box genes are Brachyury, T-brain1, Tbx1 and Tbx6. TBX2, TBX3, TBX4 and TBX5 belong to the TBX2 subfamily. TBX2 and TBX3 are the only mammalian T-box factors with reported transcriptional repressor functions. Tbx2 and Tbx3 are closely related T-box proteins that have been implicated in tissue development in different sites, including the mammary gland. TBX3 is required for normal mammary development in mouse models and in patients with ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS).123 TBX2 and TBX3 also have been implicated in tumor development through downregulation of the ARF tumor suppressor and an associated bypass of senescence.124,125 Overexpression of Bmi1, Pokemon, and Twist also contribute to tumor formation by repressing the INK4a/ARF locus.126 The TBX2 gene encoding a key developmental transcription factor is amplified and overexpressed in BRCA1 and BRCA2-mutated breast tumors.127 However, it is not known how Tbx2 mediates its repressive effect, nor whether endogenous Tbx2 or Tbx3 have a similar anti-senescence function in transformed cells. This is a particularly important question because the loss of CDKN2 A in many human cancers would, in principle, bypass the requirement for Tbx2/3-mediated repression of ARF in suppressing senescence (Fig. 1).It has been reported that TBX2 is amplified in 8.6 to 21.6 % of sporadic human breast carcinomas, where the protein is overexpressed.122 A representative picture of TBX2 overexpression in human breast cancer is shown in Figure 2c. Ectopic expression of Tbx2 results in DNA polyploidy and cisplatin resistance. 128 Thus, overexpression of Tbx2 contributes to breast carcinogenesis by accelerating cell proliferation, changing DNA ploidy, and making cells resistant to chemotherapy. More studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of TBX2/3 overexpression in breast cancer.Cyclin D1D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, and D3) are other key regulator proteins of the G1 phase progression.113,115,129,130 There are three cyclins in this family with differential effects on the development of the normal mammary gland.131 The cyclin D1 protein is synthesized in response to growth factors; its levels peak in the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle. The association of cyclin D1 to Cdk is crucial to drive cells to the restriction point where the cell is committed to divide.129,130 D-type cyclins bind to Cdks 4 and 6 and phosphorylate downstream substrates, mainly pRb, and these complexes can also sequester Cdk inhibitors (p21Cip1 and p27 Kip1) in the G1/S transition115,129,130 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, cyclin D1, the first member identified, can have Cdk-independent functions and can act as a co-factor for ER\xCE\xB1 independently of the ligand.57,58 D-type cyclins inhibit the activity of the Dmp1 transcription factor, which is a critical regulator of the Arf-p53 pathway.126,131\xE2\x80\x93138Human cyclin D1 is the product of a gene (CCND1) located on chromosome 11q13. Overexpression of cyclin D1 has been observed in many human tumors and is likely to promote cell proliferation and differentiation by shortening the G1/S transition.129,130,139 Amplification of the cyclin D1 gene has been detected in about 15% of breast cancers, while overexpression of cyclin D1 at mRNA and protein levels is seen in up to 50% of primary breast cancers, mostly ER-positive and well-differentiated tumors.129\xE2\x80\x93131 A representative picture of cyclin D1 overexpression in human breast cancer is shown in Figure 2b.Apparently the frequency of cyclin D1 gene amplification (\xE2\x88\xBC15%) is lower than the incidence of overexpression (\xE2\x88\xBC50%). Recently, Barbash et al140 demonstrated that attenuation of cyclin D1 SCFFbx4 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity occurs frequently in human cancer and may represent a common mechanism of overexpression and deregulation of cyclin D1. Significantly, inactivation of the Fbx4 ligase is the result of mutations in N-terminal regulatory regions of Fbx4 that disrupt ligase dimerization, thereby revealing the biological significance of SCF ligase oligomerization. They established Fbx4 as a tumor suppressor in human cancer, the function of which is abrogated by a unique category of mutations that target E3 ligase activity.140The relationship between overexpression of cycli

BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are also found in complexes with Rad51, a protein important for the cellular response to DNA damage.192,194 In addition, BRCA1 is phosphorylated by the ATM/ATR kinases, in response to DNA damage (Fig. 1).Thus, both BRCA proteins are now emerging as central gatekeepers of genomic stability.190,195 In studies of mice bearing a conditional knockout of the Brca1 gene, it has been implicated in mammary ductal morphogenesis and checkpoint control in the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Perhaps the most interesting among BRCA1 protein-protein interactions in mammary epithelial cells is the one with the ER\xCE\xB1.196 This apparently key anti-estrogenic effect may place the BRCA proteins on center stage for control of the sex steroid-regulated pathways, long suspected to induce breast cancer.Breast cancers of BRCA1/2 carriers more often have a high nuclear grade, poorly differentiated morphology, negativity to ER/PR/HER2, positivity to cytokeratins, overexpression of cyclin E, low expression of p27KIP1, and p53 mutations.194 BRCA1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer within an Ashkenazi Jewish population in several studies.197 Chappuis et al198 reported that BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were associated with shorter survival (58% vs. 82%, P = 0.003) in a Canadian Ashkenazi Jewish population. In another Canadian Ashkenazi Jewish population, Foulkes et al199 showed that the survival rate was 50% in those with BRCA1 mutations and 90% in their controls. Later, Robson et al200 studied 496 archived tissue blocks (43 cases of BRCA1 mutations, 14 cases of BRCA2 mutations, and 440 control patients); the overall 10-year survival rate was 62% in the BRCA1 mutation group and 86% in the control (P < 0.0001), but there was no difference in the BRCA2 mutation group versus controls.200A recent study of BRCA1/2 mutations in young breast cancer patients (age 36 or less)201 showed that carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations had a \xE2\x88\xBC25% lower 3-year survival rate and were less likely to express ER, PR, and HER2, the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Ctriple-negative\xE2\x80\x9D form of the disease associated with poor prognosis. Another study showed that patients who were mutant BRCA1/2 carriers had increased 25-year contralateral breast cancer recurrence compared with patients without those mutations; this recurrence was 1.6-fold higher in patients with BRCA1 mutations compared to BRCA2 mutations.202 Additionally, patients diagnosed prior to age 40 had a significantly better chance of survival compared to those diagnosed later in life.202 However, other studies have failed to demonstrate the prognostic values of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer, possibly because 1) the sample sizes of those with BRCA1/2 mutations was too small, 2) studies were biased by including only surviving patients, 3) there was no adjustment for therapy or other factors.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is composed of a family of five isoforms (VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD, and PLGF) which act as ligands for tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGF-Rs).203 Upon binding of VEGF to its receptors (primarily VEGFR2), intracellular signaling pathways, including MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt, are activated that mediate angiogenic switches (Fig. 1). This activation of angiogenesis in both normal and cancerous tissue is dependent on increased endothelial cell proliferation and invasion, increased vessel permeability, and recruitment of other support cells that make up the vessel architecture, such as pericytes.VEGF and angiogenesis are important to tumor growth and metastasis across a range of solid tumor types.204\xE2\x80\x93206 VEGF has been implicated as a key mediator of angiogenesis in breast cancer.206,207 In one study, Yoshiji et al207 found that VEGF expression was markedly upregulated compared with surrounding normal tissue in each of the 18 human breast tissue samples evaluated. In a separate study assessing the role of VEGF in breast cancer, Brown et al208 observed VEGF to be expressed at high levels in ductal carcinoma (comedo-type, invasive, and metastatic), but not in infiltrating lobular carcinoma. In a series of elegant experiments, Relf and colleagues209 isolated selected angiogenic factors from 64 primary breast tumors and investigated their relationship to tumor growth and progression. These factors included VEGF, transforming growth factor-\xCE\xB21 (TGF-\xCE\xB21), pleiotrophin, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor. Overall, VEGF was one of the most important mediators of tumor angiogenesis in human breast cancer tissue, and elevated VEGF levels correlated with poor survival.Toi and colleagues210 demonstrated that VEGF expression is associated with microvessel density in breast tumor biopsies. Their postoperative tissue analysis of 328 primary breast cancer patients showed a positive correlation between the rate of VEGF expression and microvessel density. While many pro-angiogenic factors have been identified in breast cancer, VEGF appears to be the only factor expressed throughout the entire life cycle of a breast tumor. Hence all the above reports have confirmed that VEGF is associated with increased microvessel density in breast cancer.The most important factor that determines survival of breast cancer patients is dissemination of cancer cells from primary site into distant organs and establishment of metastatic colonies. Comparison of gene signatures from primary tumor, regional, and distant metastasis indicates that VEGF is only overexpressed in distant metastasis and is associated with poor survival. More importantly and clinically significant, Shivakumar et al211 showed that increased serum VEGF levels were detectable in patients with metastatic compared to benign lesions and were positively correlated with tumor grade. In a retrospective study of 679 patients, Linderholm et al212 showed significantly higher levels of intra-tumoral VEGF in patients with triple-negative breast cancers compared to other types of breast cancers.Jacobs and colleagues showed that an increased risk of invasive breast cancer was correlated with 2 VEGF gene polymorphisms, VEGF-2578C and VEGF-1154G,213 both hypothesized to increase expression of VEGF. Intense angiogenic activity has been observed in inflammatory breast cancer. In an attempt to characterize the angiogenic phenotype of this disease, van der Auwera et al214 measured mRNA expression of tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis factors in patients with both inflammatory (n = 16) and noninflammatory (n = 20) breast cancer. Although both forms of the disease exhibited high levels of angiogenic activity, inflammatory breast cancer showed significantly higher mRNA expression of angiogenic and lymphangiogenic genes, including those encoding for VEGF-C and VEGF-D. These observations may help clarify why inflammatory breast cancer has a high metastatic potential via hematogenous and lymphatic routes.Potential use of molecular prognostic markers for early detection, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of breast cancerThe use of classical markers such as Ki67, ER, PR, and HER2 for the prediction of patients\xE2\x80\x99 survival and treatment response of breast cancer has been well established, and thus, they will be continued to be used as useful laboratory tests. Although numerous genetic and phenotypic alterations have been reported in breast cancer, only a handful have been fully identified and brought to clinical studies. Among molecules regulating the p53 and RB tumor suppressor pathways, mutation of p53, overexpression of cyclin D1b, LMW cyclin E are apparently associated with poor clinical outcome of patients. Experiments using transgenic/knockout mice for these molecules have provided unique perspectives of these molecules to the biology of breast cancer. Although p53 mutations have been extensively studied in human breast cancer, only a few studies have been conducted on the prognostic values of the upstream regulators for p53, such as overexpression of Hdm2, TBX2/3, Pokemon, or inactivation of p14ARF, hDMP1. It is expected that p53 will remain intact when upstream p53 regulators are altered in tumor cells. Examination of human breast cancer samples for the alterations of these molecules and determination of their prognostic values will be useful for future diagnosis, development of novel therapies, and prevention of breast cancer.\",\"id\":\"1de22018-842e-4a9e-bb34-7e2efee52e46\",\"_version_\":1534952611034169344}]}}\n"

2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: ed using Luciferase assays, functionally confirmed that ID4 is a direct target of miR-342. This miRNA could therefore be involved in the modulation of ID4 in breast cancer. When we evaluated mRNA levels of ID4 and BRCA1 in our cohort of cases and in the validation set, we observed a negative association of their expression that suggested a role for the possible interaction of the two genes in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, possibly through miR-342 mediated regulation of ID4 that modulates BRCA1. microRNA operated regulation of BRCA1 has already been reported in another study where miR-335 was shown to target four different modulators of BRCA1 expression, including ID4 [46]. However, interaction of ID4 with miR-335 was very weak compared with that of the other BRCA1 modulators (ER\xCE\xB1, IGF1R and SP1) and no reduction of Luciferase activity was shown with the ID4 construct. Most likely, the effect of miR-335 on BRCA1 expression was operated through the other three targets. Our study shows that miR-342 directly binds ID4, as demonstrated by the Luciferase reporter assay, and the BRCA1 modulation we observed in the cellular model was actually provoked by the reduction of ID4 as ER\xCE\xB1, IGF1R and SP1 are not predicted targets of miR-342. Wen et al. found that triple negative breast cancers present high levels of ID4 protein respect to the other breast cancers and propose that overexpression of ID4 could functionally inactivate BRCA1 in this tumor type which presents characteristics similar to BRCA1-mutant tumors and downregulation of BRCA1 [45]. In the case series we analyzed, we observed a correlation between miR-342 and BRCA1 expression for the ER-negative cases that were mostly also PGR- and ERBB2- negative. However, the fact that most of them were also BRCA1-mutant cases has so far prevented us to demonstrate a direct link between cancer and reduced expression of the gene. The correlation between miR-342 and BRCA1 was not confirmed in the independent data set, where the ER-negative series also included non PGR- and ERBB2-negative cases. However, the fact that the inverse correlation between ID4 and miR-342 and ID4 and BRCA1 remained statistically significant highlights that the interplay between the miRNA and the two genes could exist. On the other hand, we successfully demonstrated the interplay between miR-342 and the two genes in MDA-MB-231 cells that share the features of the clinical \xE2\x80\x9Ctriple negative\xE2\x80\x9D tumor type for their ER, PR and HER2 negative status, and have been classified in the basal B subtype based on their transcriptional profile [47], [48]. The reason why we chose this triple negative cell line was that it expressed high levels of ID4 compared with the other triple negative cell lines analyzed. Moreover, because of its endogenous low expression of miR-342, it represented a good model where to do the overexpression of miR-342 and to study its effects on ID4 and BRCA1 interaction. To support our hypothesis, overexpression of miR-342 in MCF7 cells, that are ER-positive and present high levels of miR-342 and BRCA1 but low ID4 expression, only resulted in a weak reduction of ID4 that has no effects on BRCA1 expression. We also evaluated changes in the expression of ID4 and BRCA1 in the BRCA1-mutant cell line HCC1937 and found that transfection of miR-342 strongly reduced ID4, but not BRCA1 expression. However in these cells ID4 and miR-342 are expressed at lower levels than in MDA-MB-231 that perhaps are not enough for activating the mechanism of BRCA1 modulation operated by ID4.The fact that the cohort of patients we analyzed also included heredo-familial cases prevented us from observing a direct effect of miR-342 on BRCA1 activity since most of the ER-negative cases analyzed were BRCA1-mutant. However, these samples had higher expression of ID4 and lower expression of BRCA1 compared to sporadic and BRCA2-mutant cases, and the same correlation for BRCA1 and ID4 was observed for the BRCAx group. This observation suggests that at least part of the familial predisposition to breast cancer of the heterogeneous BRCAx group could be explained by a regulatory effect of ID4 on BRCA1, possibly involving miR-342. However, we can only speculate that miR-342 has a role in the reduced expression of BRCA1, since all the BRCAx cases we analyzed where ER-positive (and this miRNA is lower in an ER-negative context). To validate this hypothesis, measurement of expression levels of miR-342, ID4 and BRCA1 and the assessment of their correlation should be extended to a larger cohort of BRCAx samples including ER-negative cases. Results from larger investigations could clarify if miR-342 can be considered an additional player in the genetic predisposition to breast cancer.Supporting InformationFigure S1Association of individual miRNA expression differences between samples and ER, PR and HER2 status.

In addition, other molecules in the RB pathway have not been measured simultaneously. In spite of these limitations, there appears to be a relationship between cyclin D1 gene amplification and poor disease outcome in ER-positive patients.144\xE2\x80\x93146 In contrast, cyclin D1 protein expression is associated with a good prognosis in some studies,141,147 potentially as a consequence of its positive relationship with ER expression and negative relationship with RB mutations. However, other studies failed to confirm this relationship.142,148Interpretation is further complicated by suggestions that under some circumstances, cyclin D1 overexpression may worsen clinical outcome by conferring resistance to endocrine treatments.149,150 Consistent with this possibility, one small clinical study suggested that the duration of response to tamoxifen was significantly longer in ER-positive patients with low cyclin D1 than those with high cyclin D1.150 Resolution of these issues must await more detailed analysis of cyclin D1 expression and patient outcomes in the context of prospective randomized clinical trials.The CCND1 locus encodes two gene products, cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b, which have discrete mechanisms of regulation and impact on cell behavior.151,152 A polymorphism at nucleotide 870 in the CCND1 gene, rs603965, influences the relative production of the encoded proteins and can reveal increased risk for tumor development. Millar et al153 studied the impact of both the G/A870 polymorphism and cyclin D1b protein production on breast cancer risk, disease phenotype and patient outcome. In a large multiethnic case-control study, the G/A870 polymorphism conferred no significant risk for breast cancer overall, by stage or ER status. However, the cyclin D1b protein was upregulated in breast cancer, independent of cyclin D1a levels, and exhibited heterogeneous levels in breast cancer specimens. High cyclin D1a expression inversely correlated with the Ki67 proliferation marker, but was not associated with clinical outcome. In contrast, elevated cyclin D1b expression was independently associated with adverse outcomes, including recurrence, distant metastasis, and decreased survival.153 Cyclin D1b overexpression was particularly associated with poor outcome in ER-negative breast cancer. Thus, specific cyclin D1 isoforms are associated with discrete forms of breast cancer and high cyclin D1b protein levels hold prognostic potential.Cyclin D2 is more ubiquitously expressed in tissues than cyclin D1. Cyclin D2 is expressed in normal human mammary epithelial cells, but interestingly, its overexpression is rare in breast cancers.154,155 This is due to promoter hypermethylation in most cases.156 Its functional significance, if any, in breast oncogenesis has yet to be determined, although potential roles of cyclin D2 in terminal differentiation and senescence of human breast epithelium have been proposed. Indeed, MMTV-cyclin D2 mice show increased proliferation of mammary glands in pregnant females, but alveolar differentiation is partially or completely inhibited.157 In one report, cyclin D3 was overexpressed in breast cancers, but there are limited data on its relationship to the phenotype of breast cancer and prognosis of patients.158 Keyomarsi et al showed that the absence of cyclin D1 or cyclin D3 protein expression was associated with improved disease-specific and overall survival, but the correlations were less striking than those for cyclin E.159Cyclin ECyclin E is the limiting factor for G1 phase progression and S phase entry. The cyclin E gene is a target of E2Fs and the protein associates with Cdk2 and activates its kinase activity shortly before entry of cells into the S phase113,115,129 (Fig. 1). The restriction point \xE2\x80\x9CR\xE2\x80\x9D at the transition between G1- and S-phases of the cell cycle has been recognized as the endpoint of regulatory pathways that are critical for growth control, and thus also for prevention of excessive or unrestricted growth. Deregulation of these pathways\xE2\x80\x94or the deletion or overexpression of particular factors that are substantial for these pathways\xE2\x80\x94 have been linked to malignant transformation of cells and the development of cancer. While there is evidence of the importance of cyclin D1 in mammary tumorigenesis,160 the role of cyclin E in this respect has only recently been established. Cyclin E is expressed in supra-physiological levels in many human cancers and its genomic locus (19q12-q13) is frequently amplified.161,162 High levels of cyclin E and low levels of the G1-specific cell cycle inhibitor p27KIP1 exhibit a good correlation.159,163\xE2\x80\x93169 Another clue for the importance of cyclin E in breast carcinoma is the finding of centrosome amplifications in these tumors, which could pave the way for genomic instability.170\xE2\x80\x93172Two proteins codified by two different genes but with high homology, called cyclin E1 (formerly cyclin E) and cyclin E2 have been identified.173\xE2\x80\x93177 Cyclin E2, like cyclin E1, associates with Cdk2 and activates its kinase activity at the G1/S boundary.176 Cyclin E2 shares 47% overall similarity to cyclin E1; whether its structural features outside the conserved regions reveal unique functions is unknown.176Increased expression of cyclin E1 has been reported in approximately 40% of breast cancer cases,159,178,179 and of cyclin E2 in 38% of primary ER-negative breast cancers.176 Elevated levels of both cyclins were more frequently found in ER-negative than in ER-positive tumors.176 The prognostic role of cyclin E (E1) has been retrospectively evaluated in a number of studies.180\xE2\x80\x93187 Keyomarsi et al found that the overexpression of the cyclin E protein was accompanied by the appearance of low molecular weight (LMW) isoforms, and both were a reliable prognostic marker in stage I\xE2\x80\x93III breast cancer patients. In fact, the hazard ratio for death due to breast cancer in patients with high levels of cyclin E was higher than associated with any other biological marker examined (seven times higher than the hazard ratio associated with lymph node metastases). Of note, all node-negative patients with high levels of cyclin E (12 out of 114) died of breast cancer. In some studies, a correlation between cyclin E and high histological grade181,182,184,186 or ER negativity180,187 has been reported, while an inverse correlation with p27KIP1 was observed in a study where both factors were prognostic.168To study the oncogenic potential of the LMW forms of cyclin E in breast carcinogenesis, transgenic mice expressing full-length cyclin E alone, full-length and the EL4 isoforms, or the EL2/3 isoforms of cyclin E were generated under the control of MMTVLTR.188,189 Both primary mammary tumor formation and metastasis were markedly enhanced in LMW cyclin E-transgenic mice. LMW cyclin E overexpression in mammary epithelial cells of mice was sufficient to induce mammary carcinomas in 34 of 124 (27%) animals compared with 7 of 67 (10%) mice expressing only the full-length cyclin E, suggesting higher oncogenic activity of the LMW form.188 In addition, metastasis was more frequently found in LMW cyclin E tumor-bearing animals compared with tumors in mice with the full-length cyclin E background (P < 0.05). They also reported that LMW cyclin E overexpression selected for inactivation of p53 by LOH and frequent inactivation of p19Arf, canceling the protective checkpoint function of the Arf-p53 pathway and accelerating progression to mammary carcinomas.188,189BRCA1 and BRCA2Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 located in chromosome 17q21 and 13q13, respectively, are involved in breast carcinogenesis.190 The gene was subsequently cloned and found to be novel, containing an aminoterminal, zinc- and DNA-binding \xE2\x80\x9Cring finger\xE2\x80\x9D motif; a carboxyl-terminal BCRT domain; and a nuclear localization sequence. Interestingly, mutations are particularly prevalent in breast cancers of Ashkenazi Jewish women and other select populations,191 but some families carrying BRCA mutations have few afflicted members. In other studies comparing different carrier populations, BRCA1 mutations were reported (but rarely) in women with no familial association of the disease.192 BRCA1 mutations were also associated with shorter survival (63% vs. 91%, P = 0.04) in a study of 249 European patients (36 patients with BRCA1 mutations, 8 with BRCA2 mutations, and 205 controls).193 These studies emphasize the variable penetrance of inherited risk conferred by this gene.Although mutations in the BRCA1 gene are widely prevalent in patients with familial breast and ovarian cancer, mutations are rarely detected in sporadic breast cancers. BRCA2 is associated with familial cancers of the female and male breast and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries. Its gene shares homology with BRCA1, and its encoded protein has similar biochemical functions to BRCA1. However, BRCA2 mutation appears less involved in risk of ovarian cancer compared to BRCA1. Mutations of BRCA2 confer risk of male breast cancer and (to a more limited extent) several other cancers, such as prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-Hodgkin\xE2\x80\x99s lymphoma, basal cell carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, and fallopian tube tumors.Current studies using CGH and cDNA microarray analysis suggest a distinct signature of chromosome gains and losses and gene expression for the different classes of familial breast cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX) compared to sporadic breast cancers.194 BRCA1 appears to interact with the p53 protein (leading to induction of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21Cip1/WAF1; Fig. 1)195 directly, with the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, with the transcription f

For the five to ten percent of women who have a strong inherited predisposition to breast cancer [1], more aggressive prevention strategies\xE2\x80\x94such as chemoprevention or prophylactic mastectomy/oophorectomy\xE2\x80\x94may be recommended\xC2\xA0in addition to or instead of surveillance. However, many women with a family history of breast cancer, including many who carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, never develop breast cancer. Indeed, 40-50\xC2\xA0% of women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation do not develop breast cancer by 70\xC2\xA0years of age [2]. This situation leads to uncertainty for both patient and physician regarding whether to pursue these aggressive prevention strategies, which can cause health and lifestyle effects that many women consider to be severe. For example, side effects of chemoprevention can include osteoporosis, blood clots, endometrial cancer, hot flushes, joint pain, and depression [3, 4]. Thus there is a critical need to accurately differentiate individuals from high-risk families who will develop breast cancer from those who will not develop breast cancer. Screening and prevention resources could then be focused on those women who carry the highest risk for familial breast cancer (FBC), while women with a lower risk could be spared the risks and inconveniences of prophylaxis or intensive screening. Optimally, such an approach would be non-invasive and provide estimates of risk that are tailored to each individual.One existing method for estimating breast-cancer risk is based on personal health history, family health history, and demographic variables [5]; however, this approach is designed as a population-wide screening tool\xE2\x80\x94not specifically for individuals from high-risk families\xE2\x80\x94and the predictive accuracy of this method is limited [6]. Others have examined the potential to predict breast-cancer risk based on genetic or epigenetic variation, and these approaches have improved prediction accuracy [7\xE2\x80\x939]. We evaluated an alternative approach, hypothesizing that by quantifying gene-expression activity in peripheral-blood cells, we would be able to identify patterns that indicate a woman\xE2\x80\x99s risk for developing breast cancer, as gene-expression profiling of normal cells has previously provided information about disease development [10\xE2\x80\x9313]. This approach aims to overcome limitations of using genetic variants to predict risk. For example, due to genetic heterogeneity, individuals who develop breast cancer differ considerably in the risk variants that they carry, and most such variants are believed to have a subtle effect on risk. Gene-expression levels reflect biological activity within cells and serve as proxies for genetic (and epigenetic) variation within normal cells as well as tumor cells [10, 14, 15]. Indeed, it has been shown that global expression levels in lymphoblastoid cells reflect a person\xE2\x80\x99s BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation status, even when the mutations lie at different genomic loci within these genes [16]. Aberrant expression resulting from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may not be reflected phenotypically in peripheral-blood cells; however expression levels in these cells may indicate a propensity for normal cellular activity within breast cells to become disrupted. Gene-expression levels in breast tumors have been shown to reflect functional germline variation. For example, expression patterns in tumors from patients with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants exhibit distinctive patterns compared to tumors from individuals who do not carry these mutations [14\xE2\x80\x9326]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that gene-expression-levels in normal cells should be similar across many women who develop FBC and thus indicative of disease risk, even though the underlying genetic and epigenetic variation may vary considerably across these women.For this study, we examined the potential to use peripheral-blood gene-expression levels to identify women who possess the highest risk for developing FBC. We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for two independent patient cohorts and evaluated how well this gene-expression data could be used to differentiate between women who have developed FBC and women who have not, independent of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status. Our findings indicate that this approach has potential to provide women from breast cancer families with individualized estimates of breast cancer risk and therefore to guide patient decisions regarding medical management.MethodsDescription of patient cohorts and data sets and consent to publishUtahWe recruited participants via the High Risk Breast Cancer Clinic at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (Utah, USA) under Institutional Review Board approved protocols (#00022886 and #00004965). We have obtained consent from these patients to report individual patient data. We collected blood samples after breast cancer occurrence and after participants had been in remission for at least six months. In general, we considered participants to have a family history of breast cancer if two or more first-degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter) had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Among eligible participants who met these criteria, we included all those from whom we could obtain fresh mononuclear cells at the time of the study. Among 83 individuals in the Utah cohort who had a family history of breast cancer, 39 had been diagnosed with breast cancer, whereas 44 women had never been diagnosed with breast cancer and were at least 55\xC2\xA0years of age (Table\xC2\xA01). Of the participants with a breast cancer family history, 38 carried a known pathogenic mutation (identified via commercial testing) in BRCA1 or BRCA2. We excluded women who carried a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation but lacked a family history of breast cancer. To ensure that our findings were specific to familial breast cancer, we recruited 41 individuals with no known family history of breast cancer; 22 of these women had developed sporadic (non-familial) breast cancer. We matched the patients by age. The median age of blood draw was consistent across all patient subgroups in the Utah cohort (Table\xC2\xA02). We used an analysis-of-variance test to ensure that the difference in age across the subgroups was not statistically significant (p\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.064). In addition, because our goal was to demonstrate an ability to differentiate between individuals who developed familial breast cancer and individuals who did not, we also verified that there was not a significant difference in ages between these two groups (t-test p-value\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.28).Table 1Summary of patient subgroups in the Utah and Ontario populationsCategoryUtahOntarioFamily history, BRCA1/2, Cancer1611Family history, BRCAX, Cancer2317Family history, BRCA1/2, No Cancer1814Family history, BRCAX, No Cancer2618No family history, Cancer228No family history, No Cancer195Total12473Patients fell into one of six groups, depending on whether 1) they had a family history of breast cancer, 2) had been diagnosed with breast cancer previously, or 3) were known to carry a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

These data represent 117 participants from the Utah cohort. The remaining 8 Utah participants were at least 55\xC2\xA0years old; however, it was not feasible to collect their exact ages in retrospect. The median age at which blood samples were acquired was consistent across the groups (p\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.064)OntarioWe obtained de-identified samples via the Ontario, Canada site of the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR). We also obtained consent from these patients to report individual patient data. This cohort included 28 samples from women with a family history of breast cancer who had developed breast cancer, 32 from women who had a family history of breast cancer but had not developed breast cancer, and 13 from women with no family history of breast cancer, 8 of whom had developed breast cancer. Of these 73 women, approximately half were post-menopausal. We obtained, isolated, and stored blood samples for these women when they first enrolled in the BCFR.Genomic data acquisition and depositionWe used the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to isolate PBMCs from whole blood in cell-preparation tubes following manufacturer (Becton-Dickinson) protocol. Within two hours, we extracted RNA using the RiboPure RNA Isolation Kit, and hybridized the RNA to Affymetrix Genechip Human Exon 1.0 ST microarrays. Hybridization and scanning were performed at Duke University (for Utah samples and for half of the Ontario samples) and at Boston University School of Medicine (for the remaining Ontario samples).Microarray data normalizationTo correct for array- and probe-level background noise, we applied our Single-channel Array Normalization algorithm [27] to the Affymetrix microarray data. We subsequently used the PLANdbAffy database [28] to limit our analysis to microarray probes that were classified as high quality (\\\"green\\\") and that did not map to a single-nucleotide variant. For each microarray, we summarized the remaining 2,201,005 probes into gene-level values using a 10\xC2\xA0% trimmed mean. In addition, we excluded genes that contained fewer than five probes.Because the microarrays had been processed at different facilities and a

We used cohort and processing facility to define the batches. We applied ComBat two separate times: 1) to the Utah samples and Ontario samples that were processed at Duke University and 2) to the same Utah samples (processed at Duke University) and to the Ontario samples that were processed at Boston University. Strong batch effects existed before adjustment, but after ComBat adjustment, no clear pattern remained between batches and gene-expression levels (Additional file 1: Figure S1). We have deposited the raw and processed data files in Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE47862).Gene-expression data filteringTo identify blood markers that could influence mRNA expression but that may cause confounding effects, we used a total lymphocyte enumeration test to evaluate the blood cells. This test provided total counts of CD4-positive T cells, CD8-positive T-cells, CD3-positive T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells. These counts were available for 22 samples from the Utah cohort. Furthermore, we obtained epidemiological and demographic data via a health-assessment survey for 63 patients from the Utah cohort. The health survey variables we collected were age, education level, marital status, religious preference, health status, physical activity, age at menarche, contraceptive use, total number of pregnancies, total number of live births, age at first live birth, age at last live birth, breastfeeding status, time since last menstrual period, age of menopause, chemopreventive drug use (selective estrogen receptor modulators), alcohol use, tobacco use, occupational history, immunological disorder history, hypertension drug use, and anti-inflammatory drug use. Additional files 2, 3 and 4 list these values. Additional file 5 indicates cancer, family-history, and BRCA1/2 status for these patients. Using a multifactor analysis of covariance model, we excluded genes whose expression patterns correlated with any of these variables at a 0.01 significance level. Additional file 6 indicates which genes were excluded.Evaluation of normal breast cell expressionWe downloaded data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE17072), which had been produced by Lim, et al. [30]. These data contained gene-expression levels for normal breast cells\xE2\x80\x94acquired via prophylactic mastectomy or reduction mammoplasty\xE2\x80\x94for women who had a strong family history of breast cancer and for controls, respectively. Then using the top 250 genes that were expressed more highly (according to average fold change rank) in our PBMC cells from women who had developed FBC, we used the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis analytical technique [31] to assess whether these genes were up-regulated in the Lim, et al. samples. For this tool, we used default settings, except that we did not collapse genes, and we used gene-based permutation to estimate significance.SoftwareTo identify genes whose expression differed most between FBC patients and controls, we used the Support Vector Machines-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm. We used the SVMAttributeEval module within the Weka software package [32] and configured the algorithm to remove 10\xC2\xA0% of genes in each iteration.We used the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification algorithm to predict whether each participant had or had not developed FBC. To facilitate this analysis, we used the e1071 R package (http://cran.r-project.org/package=e1071) and the LIBSVM library [33]. We used the radial-basis-function SVM kernel and tuned the \xE2\x80\x9CC\xE2\x80\x9D parameter via nested cross validation. Additionally, we used the ML-Flex software package [34] to execute the analysis on a high-performance computing cluster.To plot receiver operating characteristic curves, we used the ROCR package [35]. We used a bootstrapping procedure (10,000 iterations) to calculate 95\xC2\xA0% confidence intervals [36].Software scripts used for this study are available from https://github.com/srp33/BCSP.ResultsMultigene predictions perform well for both a Utah cohort and an external validation cohort from OntarioWe filtered the genome-wide PBMC gene-expression data by identifying genes whose expression best differentiated individuals who developed FBC from controls (see Methods). Controls were of three types: individuals with a family history of breast cancer who themselves did not develop breast cancer by age 55 or greater; individuals with no family history of breast cancer who also did not develop breast cancer; and individuals with no family history of breast cancer who did develop (sporadic) breast cancer. We then used expression values for those genes to predict FBC status for each individual using the SVM algorithm [37]. Two cohorts of samples were used for this study: a cohort from Utah and an independent cohort from Ontario; both included high-risk unaffected and affected women (see Methods for cohort details). Initially, we evaluated this approach in the Utah cohort via ten-fold cross validation. Our gene expression-based estimates of FBC development were consistently higher for women from FBC families who had developed cancer than for any subset of controls (Fig.\xC2\xA01a), attaining an AUC value of 0.76 (95\xC2\xA0% CI\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.67-0.85). Similar levels of accuracy were attained for women who carried a BRCA1/2 mutation as for women with a family history of breast cancer but with no known BRCA1/2 mutation (termed BRCAX) (Fig.\xC2\xA01a; Additional file 1: Table S1). Even at the lower confidence bounds, these AUC values are competitive with results observed in previous studies that used alternative approaches [7\xE2\x80\x939]. To further evaluate this result, we randomly permuted the class labels and observed that the biomarker\xE2\x80\x99s accuracy was highly significant (p\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.001). We also repeated cross-validation 1,000 times on the Utah data and observed that on average the best prediction results were attained using 250 genes; however accuracy was consistently high, independent of gene number (Fig.\xC2\xA02).Fig. 1Predictions of familial breast cancer status in two independent cohorts. a In a cross-validated design, we predicted familial breast cancer status for 124 women from Utah. This cohort included women who did or did not have a family history (FH) of breast cancer, who did or did not carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (BRCAX if not), and who had or had not developed breast cancer. The \xE2\x80\x9CGenomic model score\xE2\x80\x9D values represent probabilistic predictions made by the support vector machines algorithm. Higher values indicate a higher probability that a given individual had developed familial breast cancer. These scores were much higher for individuals who had a family history of breast cancer and developed a breast tumor, irrespective of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status. b In a training/testing design, we predicted whether individuals in the independent Ontario cohort had developed familial breast cancer. The support vector machines algorithm was trained on the full Utah data set. Again, the scores were considerably higher for women with a family history of breast cancer who had developed a breast tumorFig. 2Cross-validation performance of gene-expression biomarker with different quantities of genes. For the gene-expression biomarker, we used the SVM-RFE method to identify genes whose expression differed most consistently between individuals who developed familial breast cancer and individuals who did not. The sizes of these gene subsets ranged in size between 25 and 300 genes. In repeated cross-validation (1,000 iterations), predictive accuracy peaked at 250 genes and was consistent when the number of genes was 150 or higherTo test whether this biomarker approach could be applied more generally via external validation, we derived an SVM model from the full Utah data set alone, and then used this model to predict FBC development in the external and independent Ontario data set. In accordance with Institute of Medicine recommendations [38], model derivation was performed solely on the Utah data before it was tested on the Ontario samples. These predictions attained an AUC of 0.73 (95\xC2\xA0% CI\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.59-0.86; permutation p-value\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.002), showing a consistently high level of accuracy between the cohorts (Figs.\xC2\xA01 and 3; Additional file 1: Table S2).Fig. 3Sensitivity and specificity of biomarker predictions. Because the support vector machines predictions (genomic model score) are probabilistic, we evaluated various cutoff thresholds at which patients could be considered to have had a \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D probability of developing familial breast cancer. a-b Receiver operating characteristic curves illustrate the balance between sensitivity and specificity across many probability thresholds for the Utah and Ontario cohorts. c-d As the genomic model scores increase, a larger proportion of patients who fell above the threshold would have been predicted accurately to develop familial breast cancer. As the threshold approaches its maximum, the predictive accuracy for patients above the threshold is nearly perfect; however, such high thresholds would result in low sensitivity levels. A threshold near 0.2 may be optimal. Panel C represents predictions for Utah participants who had a family history of breast cancer; Panel D represents the Ontario cohort. The dashed lines represent predictions for individuals who carried a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. The dotted lines represent predictions for BRCAX individuals.

2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: ndividuals who developed breast cancer. To alleviate the concern that gene-expression changes in women who developed FBC were caused by lingering treatment effects, we also collected PBMC samples for women who had developed sporadic (non-familial) breast cancer and had received treatment. In our initial analysis, we grouped these women with the participants who had no history of breast cancer and broadly classified this group as \xE2\x80\x9Ccontrols\xE2\x80\x9D. To further assess whether the predictive gene-expression patterns we identified are specific to women who develop FBC and thus have potential to predict disease risk, we assessed how well the SVM algorithm could distinguish between individuals who developed FBC and those who developed a sporadic tumor. This comparison was identical to the initial assessment, except that the control group excluded individuals who did not develop breast cancer. In this setting, the predictions attained similar levels of accuracy (Utah AUC\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.77 [0.64-0.88]; Ontario AUC\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.69 [0.49-0.89]) as the initial analysis, although the confidence intervals were wider due to the smaller sample sizes. These findings indicate that PBMC gene-expression patterns may be useful to predict FBC risk.In addition, we tested whether similar genes were dysregulated in our predictive model if the sporadics-only control group was included or not. The SVM-RFE algorithm ranks each gene according to how strongly the gene-expression values differ between the patient groups. We found that the rankings were highly similar (Spearman's rank correlation rho statistic\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.43), whether the control group contained sporadic patients only or the full control set. This finding suggests that individuals who develop familial breast cancer exhibit different gene-expression patterns than individuals who do not develop familial breast cancer, even when compared solely against individuals who had received prior diagnosis/treatments.To affirm that the expression differences in the FBC women were not confounded by treatment with estrogen receptor pathway inhibitors, we independently evaluated a publicly available data set that profiled PBMC gene-expression levels for post-menopausal women who had or had not been treated with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, respectively (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE12517). We applied the Support Vector Machines algorithm to rank the genes according to differences in expression between women who had received a given treatment and post-menopausal women who had not received either treatment. We compared these gene rankings from this study to the original analysis that compared women who had developed familial breast cancer against controls. The gene rankings were not correlated for either treatment (Spearman\xE2\x80\x99s rho for taxomifen\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.030, aromatase inhibitors\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.029). This result suggests that the genes perturbed by hormone treatments are different from those that discriminate between women who develop familial breast cancer and those who do not.Evaluating the balance between sensitivity and specificity of predictionsThe SVM prediction scores are probabilistic values ranging between zero and one. Higher values suggest a relatively high risk of familial breast cancer, and lower values suggest a relatively low risk. In clinical settings, it is often desirable to identify a single cutoff threshold above which individuals are considered to have \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D risk. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to confirm that the sensitivity and specificity of our predictions remain strong across a broad range of thresholds (Fig.\xC2\xA03a-b). Then to identify a single threshold that may be best in clinical settings, we plotted the proportion of patients who were predicted to have \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D risk and who actually developed FBC, against a range of thresholds (Fig.\xC2\xA03c-d). As expected, this value increased as the threshold increased. Accordingly, at higher thresholds, a large proportion of patients predicted to have \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D risk would received accurate predictions. However, a tradeoff would be lower sensitivity (fewer individuals who actually developed FBC would be predicted to carry a high risk). Visual inspection of Fig.\xC2\xA03c-d suggests that a cutoff threshold near 0.2 may be optimal because the slope begins to level off (or drop temporarily). If a threshold of 0.2 were used to identify individuals at the highest risk of breast cancer in the Ontario cohort, the sensitivity would be 0.68 and the specificity would be 0.71, equating to a positive likelihood ratio of 2.35 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.45. Put another way, for a woman with a 50\xC2\xA0% chance of breast cancer based on family history and BRCA status, a prediction greater than 0.2 would suggest a 70\xC2\xA0% chance of developing breast cancer, and a score less than 0.2 would indicate a 31\xC2\xA0% chance of developing breast cancer.Biological interpretationInterestingly, many genes\xE2\x80\x94for example, DSC1, FN1, ST6GALNAC5, TP63, SHB, and WNT3\xE2\x80\x94used in the above biomarker are known to play important roles in regulating cell\xE2\x80\x93cell adhesion and cell\xE2\x80\x93ECM interactions (see Additional files 7 and 8 for complete lists). To evaluate these genes at the biological pathway level, we applied the GATHER algorithm [39] to the 250 genes that best distinguished affected FBC women from controls in the Utah and Ontario data (Additional files 9 and 10); this approach indicated a significant association between FBC development and pathways that play a role in cell adhesion, including KEGG Adherens Junctions and Extracellular Matrix-receptor Interaction (p-values\xE2\x80\x89<\xE2\x80\x890.05, Table\xC2\xA03). This finding suggests that these pathways may be fundamentally dysregulated in multiple cell types, potentially including asymptomatic breast tissue, which may be a mechanism that leads to increased risk of familial breast cancer. To assess whether the gene-expression patterns associated with FBC status in our PBMC samples also occur in normal breast cells, we examined publicly available data from Lim et al. [30] and found that patients with a strong family history of breast cancer have significantly higher overall expression (p\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.001, see Methods) for genes that were overexpressed in our FBC samples.Table 3Top pathway results from GATHER analysisTerm IDTerm\\np-valuehsa04520Adherens junction0.00149hsa00590Prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolism0.00775hsa04350TGF-beta signaling pathway0.0132hsa04510Focal adhesion0.014For genes that exhibited consistent fold-change directions in the Utah and Ontario gene-expression data (Additional files 7 and 8), we sorted the genes by average rank of fold change and t-test p-values. The 250 top-ranked genes were used to query GATHER [39] for KEGG pathways most strongly associated with this gene list. Pathways that attained a p-value less than 0.05 are shownDiscussionWomen from FBC families face greater uncertainty regarding their personal risk of breast cancer than the general population [40]. Accurate risk prediction is important in part because 54\xC2\xA0% of high-risk women fail to follow appropriate screening procedures for breast-cancer prevention, even when they have health insurance, receive reminders, and have a positive attitude toward screening [41]; however, increased perceived risk translates into increased willingness to consider effective prevention strategies such as tamoxifen [42]. Various risk-prediction models based on clinical and/or genomic data have been proposed, yet the discriminatory accuracy of these models has been modest (AUC 0.56-0.70) [6\xE2\x80\x939, 43]. Multiple studies have shown that higher accuracy levels can be obtained using gene-expression profiles of peripheral blood cells in the context of early detection [44, 45]. However, these studies have focused on general breast-cancer risk, and their approaches were tested in single cohorts. Our goal was to develop a classification approach specific to women from high-risk families\xE2\x80\x94based on PBMC gene expression\xE2\x80\x94and to validate this approach in an external cohort consisting of women from a different geographical location.Researchers have placed much emphasis on identifying additional susceptibility variants [46]; however, known susceptibility variants account for at most ~30\xC2\xA0% of familial breast cancer risk [47], and common variants currently show only moderate predictive capabilities for risk [8]. Here, we identify expression-based changes reflective of a person's risk to develop breast cancer. We emphasize the importance of additional, prospective studies with larger sample sizes to further evaluate the clinical potential of our approach (and alternative approaches); however, the confidence intervals for our results demonstrate that our sample size was large enough to obtain statistically meaningful results. Furthermore, previous studies that have used transcriptomic predictors for prognostic and diagnostic purposes have been deemed informative using similar or smaller cohort sizes [44, 45, 48].We propose that additional approaches could be used to inform women about their personal breast cancer risk. In this study, we identified multigene expression patterns in peripheral blood cells that differ between individuals who have developed familial breast cancer and those who have not. Importantly, the peripheral-blood expression patterns were predictive of familial breast cancer, independent of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status. In addition, our approach distinguished between individuals who developed familial breast cancer and those who developed sporadic breast cancer, suggesting that our approach\xE2\x80\x99s predictive ability was

[49]. Additional studies are critical to prospectively evaluate the risk-predictive utility of our approach in different clinical settings.ConclusionOur approach has the possibility to alter how women with a family history of breast cancer make decisions regarding their health. Indeed, the risk-estimation approach we present here has the ability to provide a risk assessment for each individual woman. For example, each woman within a given family or multiple women who carry a known susceptibility variant could be assigned different individual risks based on their gene-expression profile, leading to more personalized prevention decisions. These risk assessments could provide reassurance for women who are not as highly predisposed and thus may opt for monitoring and/or chemoprevention rather than prophylactic mastectomy. Alternatively, a high predicted risk could provide evidence to support prophylactic surgeries or chemopreventive intervention.Further studies will be needed to develop multi-data risk models that incorporate gene-expression based models with other informative data such as family history, clinical and demographic characteristics, and germline variants. Additionally, it will be helpful in the future to evaluate whether our findings generalize to women who have only one known first-degree relative with breast cancer (in this study, we focused on women with multiple affected first-degree relatives). However, the accuracy of our results indicates that gene expression based biomarkers hold promise for assessing individual breast cancer risk in a minimally invasive manner and that they can be applied broadly to women from high-risk families.Ethical approvalThe institutional/ethical review boards at the University of Utah and Mount Sinai Hospital approved collection and dissemination of data for this study.\",\"id\":\"2f0be48f-252f-4a5c-8432-af4150c168a5\",\"_version_\":1534952897796636672},{\"nlmTa\":\"PLoS One\",\"all\":[\"PLoS One\",\"PLoS ONE\",\"PLoS ONE\",\"2012-6-11\",\"Public Library of Science\",\"San Francisco, USA\",\"22701724\",\"3372467\",\"Deregulated miRNAs in Hereditary Breast Cancer Revealed a Role for miR-30c in Regulating KRAS Oncogene\",\"7\",\"6\"],\"isoAbbrev\":\"PLoS ONE\",\"journalTitle\":\"PLoS ONE\",\"epub\":\"2012-6-11\",\"publisherName\":\"Public Library of Science\",\"publisherLoc\":\"San Francisco, USA\",\"pmid\":22701724,\"pmc\":3372467,\"articleTitle\":\"Deregulated miRNAs in Hereditary Breast Cancer Revealed a Role for miR-30c in Regulating KRAS Oncogene\",\"volume\":7,\"issue\":6,\"body\":\"IntroductionBreast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in developed countries. The majority of breast cancers are sporadic, while familial breast cancer comprises 5\xE2\x80\x9310% of all breast cancers. Germline mutations in the currently known high risk-breast cancer genes (such as BRCA1/2) are common in familial breast cancer, but they can explain, at best, 20\xE2\x80\x9325% of the overall excess familial risk. [1]. Still, the large majority of breast cancer cases that arise in families with strong familial aggregation are not explained by mutations in any know breast cancer susceptibility gene, and are designated as BRCAX-type tumors [2].In the past decade, gene expression profiling by microarray analysis has lead to great advances in classification of human breast tumors, and the identification of five reproducible molecular subtypes of breast cancer, that have distinct biological features, clinical outcomes, and responses to chemotherapy [3]. On the other hand, there have been only a handful of studies focused on familial breast cancer, due to difficulties in collecting the tumor material, demonstrating that BRCA1/2-mutated breast tumors could be distinguished from sporadic ones based on their gene expression signatures [4].Recently, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling calls a great attention to define various types of cancers [5], [6]. miRNAs are an abundant class of small \xE2\x88\xBC22 nt long single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules acting as negative regulators at post-transcriptional level by binding the 3\xE2\x80\xB2 untranslated regions (3\xE2\x80\xB2UTRs) of their mRNA-targets [7]. miRNAs are involved in crucial biological processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation [6]. Notably, miRNA deregulation has been extensively implicated in cancer pathogenesis in various tumor types [8], [9]. The observed effects of miRNA mis-expression on tumor initiation, maintenance or metastasis can be explained by the mRNA targets and pathways they regulate, which include known tumor suppressors and oncogenes [10]. Specifically, in breast cancer, various studies have identified mis-expressed miRNAs in tumours vs. normal tissue, and shown that changes in their expression seem to define, similarly to what has been found by expression profiling of coding genes, different histological (lobular/ductal, ER+/ER\xE2\x88\x92) [11], [12] and molecular (luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, HER2+) subtypes described so far [13]. In addition, integration of miRNA and mRNA data of a set of breast cancer samples allowed the association of miRNAs to relevant cellular processes, such as proliferation, cell cycle, immune response or cell adhesion, as well as with molecular characteristics of tumors like TP53 mutations [14].Still, very little is known about the role of miRNAs in familial breast cancer. The identification of target genes and pathways regulated by miRNAs would be critical to understand their function in tumor development. In this study we sought to establish miRNA expression profiles using microarray technology of familial breast cancer tumors and comparing with normal breast tissues. Interestingly, KRAS has been identified as a target oncogene for down-regulated miRNAs. Direct regulation of KRAS by miR-30c and growth inhibition by this miRNA was experimentally demonstrated. The identification of miRNAs deregulated in familial breast tumors could provide a better understanding of the biology of familial breast cancer and could indicate novel targets for therapy.ResultsmiRNA Expression Profiling in Primary Familial Breast Tumors and Normal Breast TissueIn order to establish the miRNA profile of hereditary breast tumors, we used LNA based microRNA microarrays. After initial preprocessing we had data from 1276 hsa-miRNAs (831 hsa-miR and 434 hsa-miRPlus). A filter procedure to eliminate genes with low expression variation across the experiments (SD<0.3) and with uniformly low expression, reduced the number of miRNAs to a total of 327 hsa-miRNAs (198 hsa-miR and 118 miRPlus). In an effort to detect significant differences in miRNA expression between normal breast tissue and hereditary breast tumors, we performed a differential expression analysis. We identified 19 miRNA significantly differentially expressed (FDR<0.05) between normal breast tissue and familial tumoral samples (Figure 1). Almost all differentially expressed miRNAs were found to be down-regulated in tumor tissues, with the exception of miR-21 and miR-300 that were up-regulated in breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue (Table 1). Down-regulation of selected miRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR in an independent set of tumors (Figure S1).10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g001Figure 1Differentially expressed miRNAs between normal breast tissue and hereditary breast tumors.Heat map of the expression of the 19 miRNAs differentially expressed between normal samples and tumors, overexpression in red, lower expression in green.

HMEC cells represent normal proliferating cells and normal tissue represent preferentially non proliferating cells, therefore, down regulation of some miRNAs, such as miR-99a, miR-101 or miR-145 (Figure 1), might be related to both normal and tumoral proliferation. However, down-regulation of other miRNAs, miR-205, miR-125a/b, miR-100 or miR-30c, might have a role in more specific tumoral processes.miRNAs Commonly Deregulated in Familial and Sporadic Breast CancerInterestingly, several miRNAs that we found to be deregula

Thus, 11 of the 19 miRNAs (miR-10b, -100, -101, -125a, -125b, 130a, -143, -145, -21, -205, and -30c) were previously identified in two key studies as being miss-regulated in sporadic breast tumors in comparison to normal tissue [11], [12], suggesting that these miRNAs may play a general role in breast carcinogenesis (Figure 2). Deregulation of some of these miRNAs in sporadic tumors was also confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis in an independent set of 18 sporadic breast tumors (Figure S1).10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g002Figure 2Shared differentially expressed miRNAs in sporadic breast tumors and hereditary tumors.Venn diagrams representing commonly deregulated miRNAs in two different studies carried out in sporadic breast cancer samples [11], [12] and in the present study on hereditary breast tumors. Regardless of the genetic background or histopathological features of the tumors, there are miRNAs consistently altered in breast tumor samples.Pathway Enrichment AnalysisGiven the fact that a single miRNA can target a large number of mRNA transcripts, miss-expression of a set of miRNAs could have significant effect on cellular function by affecting multiple signaling pathways. To assess the potential impact of deregulated miRNA in hereditary breast tumors on biological processes and pathways, we used Diana miRPath web-based computational tool for biological interpretation of miRNA profiling data using over-representation analysis of biological processes and signaling pathways that are targeted collectively by co-expressed miRNAs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis has revealed that the set of differentially expressed miRNAs between normal tissue and hereditary breast tumors, targets multiple effectors of pathways involved in ubiquitilation, cell proliferation and migration. Full list of pathways that have significantly overrepresented genes (p<0.05) collectively targeted by the set of 19 differentially expressed miRNAs is shown in Table 2. Observed down regulation of miRNAs in tumors regulating expression of these genes may result in abnormally activated pathways leading to increased proliferation and/or migration abilities.10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.t002Table 2Significantly enriched signaling pathways associated to the differentially expressed. miRNAs.KEGG PathwayN\xC2\xB0 of miRNA Target Genes-LN(p-value)Gene NamesUbiquitin mediated proteolysis2017.18UBE2D1, SOCS1, UBE2D2, UBE3C, UBE1, MAP3K1, BIRC6, UBE2J1, UBE2I, SMURF1, UBE2W, CBL, BTRC, WWP1, CUL2, SOCS3, CBLB, NEDD4L, NEDD4, ITCHAxon guidance1711.88SRGAP3, PLXNA2, GNAI2, DPYSL2, ITGB1, UNC5C, EFNA3, SEMA4D, EPHB2, SEMA6D, KRAS, CFL2, NRP1, PPP3CA, RASA1, SEMA3A, NFAT5Insulin signaling pathway167.96PPARGC1A, SOCS1, MAPK8, TSC1, PDPK1, KRAS, CBL, FRAP1, CRKL, SORBS1, SOS1, FOXO1, SOCS3, CBLB, PIK3CD, AKT3O-Glycan biosynthesis67.23GALNT2, GALNT7, GALNT1, GALNT3, GCNT1, B4GALT5mTOR signaling pathway75.31TSC1, PDPK1, FRAP1, ENSG00000164327, RPS6KA3, PIK3CD, AKT3ErbB signaling pathway104.74MAPK8, NRG3, KRAS, CBL, FRAP1, CRKL, SOS1, CBLB, PIK3CD, AKT3Glycan structures - biosynthesis 1124.35GALNT2, GALNT7, GALNT1, GALNT3, CHST2, STT3B, CHST1, GCNT1, EXTL2, B4GALT5, MAN1A2, XYLT1MAPK signaling pathway203.84MAP4K4, MAPK8, MAP3K1, KRAS, MEF2C, BDNF, CRKL, TAOK1, STK4, SOS1, FGFR1, RPS6KA5, FGF2, RAP1B, PPP3CA, NF1, RASA1, MAP3K12, RPS6KA3, AKT3Regulation of actin cytoskeleton173.61ITGB1, WASL, ARHGEF6, KRAS, PIP4K2B, CRKL, CFL2, PIP4K2A, ITGA6, SOS1, FGFR1, FGF2, ITGB3, GNA13, ACTC1, PIK3CD, PFN2Adherents junction83.55IGF1R, SNAI1, WASL, SMAD2, SORBS1, FGFR1, SSX2IP, PVRL1Focal adhesion163.54BCL2, MAPK8, ITGB1, IGF1R, PDPK1, CRKL, ITGA6, SOS1, PTEN,PTENP1, RAP1B, ITGB3, ARHGAP5, CCND2, PIK3CD, AKT3, CCND1T cell receptor signaling pathway93.2KRAS, CBL, SOS1, PPP3CA, CBLB, PDCD1, NFAT5, PIK3CD, AKT3We focused on the MAPK signaling pathway since a large number of genes within this pathway were found to be commonly targeted by 8 out of 19 deregulated miRNAs in our study suggesting that these miRNAs might cooperate to affect gene expression and consequentially activation or repression of signaling pathways (Table 2). Interestingly, miR-30c has potential binding sites on 20 different target genes involved in MAPK pathway (Table S1). This miRNA potentially target important mediators of MAPK signaling, such as KRAS, RASA1, MAP3K1 and MAPK8. Furthermore, KRAS gene has been previously validated as a target of several miRNAs, including let-7, miR-143 and miR-96 [15], [16], [17]. Now, we investigated whether miR-30c could be regulating KRAS expression in hereditary breast tumors. Thus, we confirmed by pRT-PCR that miR-30c had decreased expression in both hereditary and sporadic breast tumors comparing to normal samples (Figure 3). In addition, the other KRAS regulating miRNAs, let-7 and miRNA-143 were previously found to be significantly down-regulated in breast tumors [15], [16], while miR-96 regulated KRAS in pancreatic tumors [17]. Although mutations in KRAS are infrequent in breast tumors, activation of KRAS pathway in breast cancer have been frequently found. All these data suggests that deregulation of miRNAs would be a mechanism to explain KRAS overexpression in breast tumors. The role of miR-143 and miR-145 in regulating KRAS expression was already described, however it was never described miR-30c targeting KRAS.10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g003Figure 3Validation of miR-30c expression by qRT-PCR in hereditary and sporadic tumors.Expression levels of miR-30c in an independent set of 12 familial (FamBC) and 8 sporadic tumors (SpoBC) comparing to normal breast tissue expression. Differences were estimated by t-test and p values are shown for each comparison.miR-30c Regulates KRAS ExpressionWe explored the role of miR-30c in regulation of KRAS expression. A negative correlation between miR-30c expression and KRAS protein level was observed in two breast cancer cell lines (Figure 4). In addition, several bioinformatic target prediction algorithms (DIANA microT4.0, TargetScan, PITA, PicTar, miRANDA) indicated existence of a broadly conserved putative binding site for miR-30c in the 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR of the KRAS gene (Figure 5A). To test the hypothesis that KRAS is a bona fide target of miR-30c, we constructed a reporter plasmid harboring 300 pb of the wild-type 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR region of KRAS flanking miR-30c binding site downstream of the luciferase coding region. MDA-MB-436 cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter and pre-miR-30c or scramble control. As a result, pre-miR-30c transfected cells showed a marked reduction (52%) of luciferase activity compared to scramble control, confirming the interaction between miR-30c and KRAS 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR binding site (Figure 5B). Next, we checked whether miR-30c could affect KRAS mRNA stability by performing qRT-PCR analysis in MDA-MB-436 cells transiently transfected with either pre-miR-30c or scramble control. Indeed, we observed a sharp decrease in KRAS mRNA levels upon transfections with pre-miR-30c (Figure 5C).10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g004Figure 4Correlation of expression of miR-30c and KRAS in two breast cancer cell lines.Inverse correlation between the expression level of miR-30 determine by qRT-PCR (A) and detection of KRAS protein in MCF7 and MDA-MB-436 cells (B).10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g005Figure 5miR-30c effects on KRAS expression and cell proliferation.(A) Schematic representation of miR-30c binding site within the KRAS 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR region.

Significant reduced level of KRAS mRNA expression was detected by qRT-PCR after pre-miR-30c transfection, comparing with scramble control. (D) Regulation of KRAS protein level by miR-30c. MDA-MB-436 cells were transfected with pre-miR-30c or pre-miR-scramble oligonucleotides. After 48 hours KRAS protein was evaluated by western blot. GAPDH was used as loading control. The signal in each line was quantified and the ratio of KRAS to GAPDH was determined. (E) Effect of miR-30c expression on proliferation of MDA-MB-436 cells. MTT cell viability assay was performed at 48, 72, 96, 120 or 144 hours after transfection of MDA-MB-436 cells with pre-miR-30c or pre-miR-scramble oligonucleotides.In addition, pre-miR-30c or pre-miR- control were transfected into MDA-MB-436 cells, and we confirmed a reduction of about 44% of KRAS protein level in MDA-MB-436 cells over-expressing miR-30c, in comparison to control (Figure 5D).miR-30c Affects Proliferation of Breast Cancer CellsTo gain more insight into the biological effects of miR-30c on breast tumorigenesis and given that KRAS plays a role in regulation of cell proliferation, MDA-MB-436 cells, which previously showed elevated levels of KRAS protein, were transfected with pre-miR-30c or scramble and analyzed for cell growth. As shown in Figure 5E, ectopic expression of miR-30c resulted in reduced proliferation in comparison to scramble control transfected cells. Therefore, modulation of KRAS protein level by miR-30c may explain at least in part, why down-regulation of miR-30c can promote proliferation and contribute to tumorigenesis.DiscussionmiRNA profiling studies in various tumor types have demonstrated a widespread miRNA deregulation, providing for new insights in tumor biology, improved classification and opening new avenues for development of novel targeted therapies in cancer. In this study we performed miRNA expression profiling in familial breast tumors and normal breast tissue in order to uncover deregulated miRNAs. The normal breast tissue series was obtained from healthy individuals, both from BRCA1/2- mutation carriers belonging to high risk families, and from mutation-free i
2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: ndividuals undergoing breast reduction surgery. This has enabled us to pinpoint miRNAs important for tumorigenesis, by removing the bias induced through effects of BRCA1/2 mutation on miRNA expression. We have defined down-regulation for 17 miRNAs and up-regulation of miR-21 and miR-300 in familial breast tumors when comparing to normal breast tissue.A high proportion of deregulated miRNAs in hereditary tumors were commonly found in previous studies with sporadic breast tumors, suggesting that there are miRNAs that likely regulate important oncogenes involved in both familial and sporadic tumors, irrespective of their genetic background. It was expected that comparing tumor samples with normal tissue, which is characterized by quiescent cells, would uncover miRNAs that may be mainly involved in proliferation. Expression analysis of the 19 differentially expressed miRNAs in HMEC cells, which represent normal proliferating cells, have allowed finding some miRNAs overexpressed in normal tissues that were not overexpressed in normal HMEC cells, such as miR-99a, miR-101 or miR-145, which could have a role in the control of proliferation processes in general. Other miRNAs expressed by both HMEC and normal breast and down-regulated in tumors tissue may be involved in other signaling pathways related to tumoral behavior.Moreover, the pathway enrichment analysis suggested that co-expressed miRNAs seem to collectively target a broad range of signaling pathways related to proliferation and cell migration/motility. Altered cell signaling has long been recognized as a mechanism employed by cells in the development and progression of cancer [18]. Importantly, 20 genes within MAPK signaling pathway were significantly associated with our set of deregulated miRNAs, suggesting that the inhibition of these miRNAs would result in a concomitant activation of MAPK signaling.In breast cancer, MAPKs play a key role in transducing growth signals from the extracellular environment [19], [20]. The activation of the KRAS/MAPK pathway generates a plethora of responses in breast cancer tumors and cell lines, affecting cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and transformation [21]. In breast cancer development, up-regulation of the KRAS/MAPK signaling can occur through multiple facets, and it has been shown to be increased in many breast cancer samples either by over-expression of growth-factor-receptor tyrosine kinases primarily HER2/ErbB-2, EGFR, and IGFR or by activating mutations [22], [23], [24], [25]. Although KRAS is frequently mutated in human cancers including pancreatic, colorectal and lung cancers, KRAS mutations are extremely rare in breast cancer [26], [27]. However wild-type KRAS is significantly activated in breast cancers that over-express EGFR and ErbB2 [28]. Additionally many investigators have reported over-expression of the KRAS-encoded p21 proteins in breast malignancies in comparison to normal breast tissue [29], [30] although the role of this over-expression in breast carcinogenesis has not been determined.Interestingly, KRAS was found to be a target of multiple miRNAs found to be down-regulated in breast tumors. The let-7 family of miRNAs has been shown to regulate multiple oncogenes, including KRAS and c-MYC [16], and miR-143/145 are involved in feed-forward mechanism that potentiates Ras signaling through down-regulation of KRAS and Ras-responsive element-binding protein (RREB1), which represses the miR-143/145 promoter [31]. Here we have identified a novel broadly conserved miRNA, miR-30c, as a direct negative regulator of KRAS expression. Interestingly, miR-30 and let-7 were reported to be markedly reduced in breast tumor-initiating cells and contribute to their self-renewal capacity and undifferentiated state, and ectopic expression of these miRNAs in breast tumor-initiating cell xenografts decreases their tumorigenic and metastatic potential [32]. Furthermore, it has been shown recently that higher expression of miR-30c was significantly associated to benefit of tamoxifen treatment and with longer progression-free survival [33]. Altogether, decreased expression of these miRNAs may release the negative regulation of KRAS. Interestingly, our results showed that at least three KRAS regulating miRNAs (miR-30c, miR-143, and miR-145) had significantly reduced co-expression in tumors and then these miRNAs may act together in the regulation of KRAS oncogene.Signal transduction pathways integrate signals from extracellular stimuli including mitogens, growth factors, hormones and environmental stresses- signals required for tumorigenesis. miRNA deregulation results in the complex modulation of multiple targets belonging to multiple pathways. Commonly deregulated miRNAs in both familial and sporadic breast cancer suggest that commonly altered pathways could be important for tumor progression. Here, we have demonstrated that KRAS inhibition through direct regulation by miR-30c leads to reduced proliferation in breast cancer cells. Similarly, other studies have identified KRAS as a target of several miRNAs down-regulated in tumors (let-7, miR-96 and miR-143), that also have an effect on cancer cell proliferation and tumor invasiveness [15], [16], [17]. Therefore, coordinated down-regulation of miRNAs found in breast tumors would be not only affecting KRAS oncogene expression but also may be targeting other genes of the KRAS/MAPK signaling pathway to cooperatively activate tumorigenic downstream signals.In general a strong similarity between deregulated miRNAs was found in hereditary and sporadic breast cancer when compared to normal breast tissue. However, in order to get miRNAs associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated tumors, a higher number of BRCA1/2 mutated tumors would be needed. In this regard, one study found very similar miRNA expression profiles in high grade serous ovarian carcinomas with or without BRCA1/2 mutations [34]. More studies are guaranteed to determine the role of miRNA more related to familial breast tumors and those specifically associated to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated tumors.In summary, our data defined a deregulated set of miRNAs in hereditary breast tumors, many of them commonly deregulated in sporadic breast cancer. These miRNAs mostly showed significant reduced expression in tumors comparing to normal breast tissue. One of these miRNAs, miR-30c, potentially contributes to breast malignancy formation through release of KRAS suppression suggesting that this miRNA, and likely other miRNAs also targeting KRAS/MAPK signaling, may function as tumor suppressors in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsEthics StatementInformed written consent was obtained from all patients involved in this study to perform genetic studies and to use exceeding material for research, and the research project has the approval of the ethics committee of the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), named Comit\xC3\xA9 de \xC3\xA9tica de la investigaci\xC3\xB3n y de bienestar animal del Instituto de Salud Carlos III.SamplesTumor tissue samples were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer from different Hospitals in Spain. Potential differences regarding ethnicity was not affecting in this case since all tumors were obtained from Spaniards patients. All patients belong to high-risk families with at least three members affected with breast and/or ovarian cancer and at least one of whom was younger than 50 years when diagnosed. For microarray analysis we included whole tissue sections from 22 frozen hereditary breast tumors consisting of 3 BRCA1-mutated, 5 BRCA2 and 14 non-BRCA1/2 (BRCAX) samples, and 14 normal breast tissues including 3 from BRCA1-mutation carriers, 5 from BRCA2-mutation carriers. Histopatological features of the tumors are shown in Table S2, 1 normal breast tissue from contra-lateral breast of patient with BRCAX tumor, and 5 normal breast tissues. Normal breast tissues were obtained after breast reduction surgery from healthy individuals with no family history of breast cancer, and normal breast tissue from BRCA1/2-mutation carriers were obtained after prophylactic surgery. The tissue collection used for validation included 18 paired samples from fresh sporadic breast tumors and their adjacent normal breast tissue counterparts, RNA from 6 additional and 4 normal breast tissue samples was also used for validation. In addition, expression of miR-30c expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR using RNA from FFPE tumor (12 hereditary and 8 sporadic breast tumors) and 9 breast tissue samples.Normal Human Mammary Epithelial Cells (HMEC) (Clonetics) were used to evaluate miRNA expression comparing with normal breast tissue. HMEC cells were grown in MEGM, Mammary Epithelial Growth Medium (Clonetics) supplemented with growth factors SingleQuots (Clonetics) in absence of FBS.miRNA MicroarrayTotal RNA was extracted from primary tumors using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), respectively. Microarray expression profiling was performed using miRCURY LNA\xE2\x84\xA2 microRNA Array kit (Exiqon A/S, Denmark) according to manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions, in a one-color, pair-wise comparison experimental design. Briefly, 300 ng of total RNA was labeled with Hy3 fluorescent dye and subsequently hybridized over 16 h at 56\xC2\xB0C onto a miRNA microarray chip (v.11.0\xE2\x80\x93 hsa, mmu & rno) containing 1940 capture probes, in 4 replicates, representing 831 human miRNAs annotated in miRBasev.11 database. A set of 10 synthetic Spike-in RNAs was added to total RNA sample prior to labeling and later used for quality control. Processed slides were scanned with Agilent Array scanner (Agilent Technologies), with the laser set to 635 nm, at Power 80 and PMT 70 setting, and a scan resolution of 10 \xC2\xB5m. Fluorescence intensities on 
2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: scanned images were quantified using Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies) using the modified Exiqon protocol. Average values of the replicate spots were background subtracted and log transformed and subjected to further analysis. Microarray dataset is publicly available at GEO database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/linking.html under GEO accession number GSE32922.Array Data Processing and Statistical AnalysisRaw data were quantile normalized for inter-array variability. Data was preprocessed to eliminate miRNAs with uniformly low expression or with low expression variation (SD<0.3) across the experiments, retaining 466 miRNA genes (306 hsa-miR +160 hsa-miRPlus). Average linkage hierarchical clustering (Pearson correlation, uncentered metrics) from Gene Cluster and Treeview (http://rana.stanford.edu/software) algorithms were used to obtain clustering of the data sets. To determine if there were genes differentially expressed between tumor and normal breast tissue, differential expression analysis was performed using t-test implemented in the POMELO II tool, available in Asterias web server (http://asterias.bioinfo.cnio.es) [35]. The estimated significance level were obtained by permutation testing and p-values were corrected for multiple hypotheses testing using Benjamini & Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment [36]. Those miRNAs with FDR <0.05 were selected as significantly differentially expressed.Quantitative RT-PCR AnalysisQuantitative RT-PCR analysis of miR-30c, miR-100, miR-125b and miR-320a was performed on independent series of familial tumors as well as sporadic breast tumor samples and compared to normal breast tissue samples using miRCURY LNA\xE2\x84\xA2 microRNA PCR System (Exiqon). Briefly, 10 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with miRNA specific primers and Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase, and the cDNA was used as a template for the qPCR reaction using miRNA specific LNA\xE2\x84\xA2 PCR primer and Universal PCR primer. Gene expression levels were quantified using the ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). All experiments were performed in triplicate and the mean of triplicates was used. Normalization was done with SNORA66 RNA and 5S rRNA. Relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method.Pathway Enrichment AnalysisDIANA miRPath pathway enrichment analysis (http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/) was used to gain insight into global molecular networks and canonical pathways related to differentially expressed miRNAs between normal and tumor samples. DIANA miRPath is a web-based computational tool developed to identify molecular pathways potentially altered by the expression of single or multiple microRNAs. The software performs an enrichment analysis of multiple microRNA target genes comparing each set of microRNA targets to all known KEGG pathways. Those pathways showing p-value <0.05, were considered significantly enriched between classes under comparison.Cell Culture, Constructs and TransfectionsThe MDA-MB-436 was kindly provided by Dr. K.S Massey-Brown from Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, USA, and was characterized in previous studies by our group [37]. The MDA-MB-436 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml of Penicillin G and streptomycin. Cells were split 24 h prior to all transfection assays at a confluence 40\xE2\x80\x9370%. Pre-miRNA oligonucleotides (pre-miR-30c and scramble control) were purchased from Ambion (Austin, Texas, USA). For luciferase reporter assay transfection of oligonucleotides and plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Calsbad, CA). For proliferation, and KRAS western blot analysis, pre-miRNA oligonucleotides were transfected to a 50 nM final concentration using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen).KRAS-3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR Luciferase Reporter Assay3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR sequence of the KRAS was retrieved through NCBI nucleotide database. A 300 bp fragment of the 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR region of KRAS gene containing miR-30c binding site, was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA, and cloned into a modified pGL3-Control vector (Promega) at the SacII and EcoRI site, immediately downstream of the luciferase stop codon. Primer sequences used to amplify this region were RAS3UTR-F: 5\xE2\x80\xB2CACGAATTC CACACCCCCACAGAGCTAAC3\xE2\x80\x99 and RAS3UTR-R: 5\xE2\x80\xB2TTCCCGCGGTGTTTGATATGACCAACATTCCT 3\xE2\x80\xB2. Correct vector construction was verified by direct sequencing. Dual luciferase assay was carried out by co-transfecting MDA-MB-436 cells with 25 pmol of pre-miR-30c or scramble control, along with 500 ng of KRAS 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR- firefly luciferase construct and 7.5 ng of Renilla luciferase vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per well, according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s protocol in a 24-well plate format. Cells were grown for 48 h, after which luciferase activity was assayed with Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Experiments were performed in triplicate and Renilla luciferase activity was used for transfection variation normalization.Detection of KRAS mRNA and Protein LevelsTo detect gene expression levels of KRAS, one \xC2\xB5g of total RNA was reverse transcribed using MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers. The cDNAs were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR assay with the use of labeled probes (Roche Universal Probe library) and the TaqMan Universal PCR Mix in an ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) under manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s recommendations. The PCR amplification was carried out with 10 min at 95\xC2\xB0C, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95\xC2\xB0C and 1 min at 60\xC2\xB0C, using the oligonucleotides shown in Table S3. \xC3\x9F-actin was used as internal control and allowed normalization of the samples. All experiments were analyzed in triplicate.Western blot analysis was performed using standard procedures for whole-cell extracts from cell lines. Lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of protein lysates (50\xE2\x80\x93100 \xC2\xB5g) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\xE2\x80\x9312% pre-casted gels (Invitrogen), and electrotransferred to nitrocelulose membranes (Wathman) and probed with primary antibody. Antibodies used were KRAS (F234, Santa Cruz) and GAPDH (CNIO, Monoclonal Antibodies Unit). Secondary antibody staining was carried out with anti-mouse HRP IgG (Dakko) and HPR activity was detected with ECL Detection System (GA Healthcare).Cell Proliferation AssayCell viability was assessed by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MDA-MB-436 cells were transfected in independent experiments with pre-miR-30c/pre-miR-Scramble oligonucleotides. Cells were incubated in 1 \xC2\xB5g/\xC2\xB5l MTT Formazan (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in normal culture medium at 37\xC2\xB0C for 5 h. Cell viability was determined at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 or 144 hours after transfection.Supporting InformationFigure S1Validation of miRNA expression by qRT-PCR in hereditary and sporadic tumors.

Although deaths from BC have been decreasing in many Western countries, the incidence of the disease continues to increase. In particular, in countries with historically low incidence, BC rates are rising rapidly, making it now the world\xE2\x80\x99s most prevalent cancer. The increase in incidence is likely at least partly related to changes in weight and reproductive patterns associated with Western lifestyle. Indeed, there is evidence from genetic studies in the US, Iceland, and the UK [2\xE2\x80\x934] of a more-than-threefold increase in age-related incidence of BC not only in the general population but also in those at the highest level of risk with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the last 80\xC2\xA0years [4]. BC rates are also rising in women who have not generally been screened, such as those in their forties [1]. Although cure rates continue to improve such that around 75\xC2\xA0% of women are now cured in Western Europe and North America, the cost of treating BC is considerable, for both the women concerned and health services. Therefore, there is a need not only to predict which women in the whole population will develop the disease but also to apply drug and lifestyle measures in order 
2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: to prevent the disease. BC risk assessment would be essential if risk-stratified screening and preventive measures were to be introduced on a population basis.Currently, women 47 to 73\xC2\xA0years of age are invited for breast screening with 3-yearly mammography in the UK. A similar approach is used in many European countries and in North America, although 2-yearly screening is the norm. A recent review of the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) estimated that it saved around 1,300 lives annually [5]. Although the vast majority of women in the UK receive only 3-yearly screening invitations, more frequent screening has been recommended by National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [6] since 2004 for those at increased familial risk. This includes annual mammography at 40 to 9\xC2\xA0years for women at moderate risk and annual screening at 40 to 60\xC2\xA0years in those at high risk; annual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended at 30 to 50\xC2\xA0years in mutation carriers and those with at least a 30\xC2\xA0% chance of a mutation in BRCA1/2 or TP53. This guidance has just been updated, and the high-risk recommendations are already being implemented in the NHSBSP as highlighted recently [7]. Recent evidence suggests that stratification of risk and screening frequency is likely to be more cost-effective [8\xE2\x80\x9310]. A substantial amount of BC is preventable, but chemoprevention has thus far not been applied to moderate/high-risk UK women outside randomised trials. Chemoprevention involves 5\xC2\xA0years of the selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen or raloxifene, which reduce risk by 35\xC2\xA0% to 40\xC2\xA0% [11\xE2\x80\x9313]. NICE have reviewed chemoprevention for women at moderate/high familial BC risk (at least 17\xC2\xA0% lifetime). Final guidance is \xE2\x80\x98offering/considering\xE2\x80\x99 tamoxifen/raloxifene for women at high/moderate risk [13, 14]. However, applying such guidance requires estimation of risk in the general population of women [15, 16]. (Key NICE recommendations are summarised in Table\xC2\xA01).Table 1Key NICE guideline recommendations relating to risk-based early detection and prevention strategiesEarly detection and prevention strategiesModerate risk Lifetime risk 17\xC2\xA0% to 29\xC2\xA0%High risk Lifetime risk 30\xC2\xA0%\xE2\x80\x89+\xE2\x80\x8910-year risk 8\xC2\xA0%+Gene carriers and 30-50\xC2\xA0% likelihood for TP53, BRCA1, or BRCA2\\n10-year risk 3\xC2\xA0% to 7.9\xC2\xA0% from age 40 to 49\xC2\xA0yearsMammographyAnnual from age 40 to 49Annual from age 40 to 59Annual from age 40 to 69 except TP53\\nMagnetic resonance imagingN/AN/AAnnual from age 30 to 49, 25 to 59 for TP53\\nTamoxifenConsider 5\xC2\xA0years of 20\xC2\xA0mg dailyOffer 5\xC2\xA0years of 20\xC2\xA0mg dailyOffer 5\xC2\xA0years of 20\xC2\xA0mg dailyRaloxifene (post-menopausal)Consider 5\xC2\xA0years of 60\xC2\xA0mg dailyOffer 5\xC2\xA0years of 60\xC2\xA0mg dailyOffer 5\xC2\xA0years of 60\xC2\xA0mg dailyN/A, not applicable; NICE, National Institute of Health and Care ExcellencePrevious attempts to undertake risk assessment on a population basisThere have been previous attempts to assess family history of BC in women at the population level [17, 18]. In a study using questionnaires in a general practice [17], 42.0\xC2\xA0% of patients responded and 1.6\xC2\xA0% were found to meet familial BC screening criteria at the time [19]. These data were based on only 196 replies in this age range, and the criteria were stricter at the time than later NICE guidance as there was a necessity for an average age of less than 60\xC2\xA0years when there were two affected relatives. In a study predominantly concerning family history of 8,019 practice patients 35 to 69\xC2\xA0years of age [17], only 4.8\xC2\xA0% reported having a first-degree relative (FDR) with BC who was less than 70\xC2\xA0years old. The general practice survey was based on nurses appraising BC family history at attendance for health checks and may be biased toward a more health-aware population. A different approach was taken by a Dutch study [20] that assessed the number of relatives of BC patients who would meet criteria for referral in The Netherlands under the older UK criteria [19]. The investigators found that 0.25 FDRs per patient (or an average of one for every four patients with BC) would have met eligibility criteria per case of BC in a series of 1,060 BC-affected women. If one assumes that 12.5\xC2\xA0% of women develop BC in their lifetime [1], this might translate to 3.1\xC2\xA0% (that is, 12.5\xE2\x80\x89\xC3\x97\xE2\x80\x890.25) of the population. As such, family history alone is a blunt tool in a population setting and overall has poor prediction of which women will develop BC as the majority of women even with early-onset BC do not have a family history of the disease [21].Which risk model should be used?A number of BC risk models have been developed in the last 25\xC2\xA0years [22]. These incorporate known genetic, reproductive, and other risk factors to a greater or lesser extent (Table\xC2\xA01). Age and gender alone are extremely strong predictors of BC risk. Gail and colleagues [23, 24] described a risk assessment model which focuses primarily on non-genetic risk factors with limited information on family history. A model of relative risks for various combinations of the utilised risk factors (Table\xC2\xA02) was developed from case-control data from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project. Individualized BC probabilities from information on relative risks and the baseline hazard rate are generated. These calculations take competing risks and the interval of risk into account. The data depend on having periodic breast surveillance. The Gail model was originally designed to determine eligibility for the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial [23] and has since been modified (in part to adjust for race) and made available on the National Cancer Institute website [25]. The model has been validated in a number of settings and probably works best in general assessment clinics, where family history is not the main reason for referral [23\xE2\x80\x9325], but it should also be useful for utilization in general population screening programmes, as it has now been recalibrated to reflect more recent BC incidence rates. The major limitation of the Gail model is the inclusion of only first-degree relatives, which results in underestimating risk in the 50\xC2\xA0% of the group with familial risk of cancer in the paternal lineage. The model also takes no account of age of onset of BC.Table 2Known breast cancer risk factors and their incorporation into existing risk prediction modelsRelative risk at extremesGailClausBRCAPRO FordTyrer-CuzickBOADICEAPredictionPersonal informationAge (20 to 70)30 (20 versus 70)YesYesYesYesYesBody mass index/weight gain2 (loss versus gain from 30) [49]NoNoNoYesNoAlcohol intake1.28 [28] (0 versus 4 units) dailyNoNoNoNoNoHormonal/reproductive factorsAge of menarche1.5 (<10 versus >16) [57]YesNoNoYesNoAge of first live birth3 (>35 versus <19) [58]YesNoNoYesNoAge of menopause2 (>55 versus <40) [57]NoNoNoYesNoHormone replacement therapy use2 (combined for 10\xC2\xA0years current versus never) [59]NoNoNoYesNoOral contraceptive pill use1.24 (current versus never) [60]NoNoNoNoNoBreast feeding0.8 (>4\xC2\xA0years versus none) [61]NoNoNoNoNoPlasma oestrogen6 [62]NoNoNoNoNoPersonal breast diseaseBreast biopsies2 [63]YesNoNoYesNoAtypical ductal hyperplasia4 [63]YesNoNoYesNoLobular carcinoma in situ\\n4 [63]NoNoNoYesNoMammographic breast density6 [64]Has been modelled in some studiesNoNoYesNoFamily historyFirst-degree relatives3.6 [65] (2 versus none in FDR)YesYesYesYesYesSecond degree relatives1.5 [65]NoYesYesYesYesThird-degree relativesNoNoNoNoYesAge of onset of breast cancer3 (<50 in sister versus none) [65]NoYesYesYesYesBilateral breast cancer3 (<50 in FDR versus none)NoNoYesYesYesOvarian cancer1.5 [26]NoNoYesYesYesMale breast cancer3 (<45\xC2\xA0years in daughters) [64]NoNoYesYesYesGenetic testing\\nBRCA1/2\\n15NoNoYesYesYesSNPs10 (top 1\xC2\xA0% versus bottom 1\xC2\xA0% for 77 SNPs) [67]Has been added in some studiesNoSoonSoonSoonBOADICEA, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm; FDR, first-degree relative; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism. Table adapted from [68]The Claus model [26] and BRCAPRO [27] are primarily genetic models calculating the likelihood of either a putative high-risk dominant gene [26] or BRCA1/2 [27]. BC risks are imputed from this calculation. As such, given the rarity of BRCA1/2 or the putative dominant gene in the Claus model, these models are useful in the familial setting only and are not relevant to assessment on a population basis in which the great majority of women have no family history. BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm) [28] is another model developed primarily to assess genetic risk but has been validated in a population-based series of BCs. Although inclusion of non-genetic risks are anticipated, these are not yet available in the online model.The Tyrer-Cuzick model [29], based partly on a dataset acquired from the International Breast Intervention Study (IBIS) and other epidemiological data, incorporates both familial and non-genetic risk factors in a comprehensive way [29]. The major advantage over the Claus model and BRCAPRO is that the model gives consideration to the presence of multiple genes of differing penetrance. It does give a read-out of BRCA1/2 but also gives consideration to a lower-penetrance BRCAX. As such, the Tyrer-Cuzick model addresses many of the pitfalls of the previous models, significantly the combination of extensive family history, markers of endogenous oestrogen exposure, and benign breast disease (atypical hyperplasia). Therefore, it is unsurprising that the model tends to perform better than
2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]:  the simpler Gail model, particularly in the familial setting [22].Mammographic densityMammographic density is the single assessable risk factor with the largest population-attributable risk and also has a substantial heritable component [30, 31]. The difference in risk between women with extremely dense, as opposed to predominantly fatty, breasts is approximately four- to six-fold [32]. Incorporation of mammographic density into standard risk prediction models has been associated with some improvement in precision of risk prediction [33, 34].Genetic variant assessmentA large number of common genetic variants have now been linked to small increases or decreases in BC risk [35]. These variants, called single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), appear to act in a multiplicative fashion. Those women with no family history of BC can potentially reach a high lifetime risk from the multiplicative effects of SNPs alone [36]. So far, 94 validated SNPs for BC risk have been published [37]. Use of a much smaller panel of SNPs did improve the Gail model in predicting BC [38] and seems to be particularly useful in women with dense breasts [39]. One study identified the proportion of the female population who are at moderate or high risk of BC and hence eligible for increased surveillance and the offer of chemoprevention as per NICE guidance [40]. This study in Canada also showed that Tyrer-Cuzick substantially outperformed the Gail model [40].Model validation in the general populationA study from Marin County in California [41] used data from 12,843 participants who have a higher background risk of BC. Of these women, 203 developed BC during a 5-year follow-up period, showing that Tyrer-Cuzick has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.65 (95\xC2\xA0% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.68) compared with 0.62 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.59 to 0.66) for Gail and 0.60 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.56 to 0.63) for BRCAPRO. The corresponding estimated expected-to-observed ratios for the models were 1.08 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.95 to 1.25), 0.81 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.71 to 0.93), and 0.59 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.52 to 0.68). In women with an age at first birth of more than 30\xC2\xA0years, the AUCs for the Tyrer-Cuzick, Gail, and BRCAPRO models were 0.69 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.62 to 0.75), 0.63 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.56 to 0.70), and 0.62 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.56 to 0.68) and the expected-to-observed ratios were 1.15 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.89 to 1.47), 0.81 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.63 to 1.05), and 0.53 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.41 to 0.68), respectively. A further North American study has shown that Tyrer-Cuzick substantially outperformed the Gail model [42]. The authors applied 10-year absolute risks of BC, using prospective data from 1,857 women over a mean follow-up length of 8.1\xC2\xA0years of whom 83 developed cancer. The 10-year risks assigned by Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick differed ranging widely from 0.001\xC2\xA0% to 79.5\xC2\xA0%. The mean Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick assigned risks of 3.2\xC2\xA0% and 5.5\xC2\xA0%, respectively, were lower than the cohort\xE2\x80\x99s 10-year cumulative probability of developing BC of 6.25\xC2\xA0%. Agreement between assigned and observed risks was better for Tyrer-Cuzick (HL X4(2)\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x897.2, P\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.13) than for Gail, which significantly under-predicted cancers (P\xE2\x80\x89<\xE2\x80\x890.001). The Tyrer-Cuzick model also showed better discrimination (AUC\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x8969.5\xC2\xA0%, CI\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x8963.8\xC2\xA0% to 75.2\xC2\xA0%) than the Gail model (AUC\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x8963.2\xC2\xA0%, CI\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x8957.6\xC2\xA0% to 68.9\xC2\xA0%). In almost all covariate-specific subgroups, Gail mean risks were significantly lower than the observed risks, whereas Tyrer-Cuzick risks showed generally good agreement with observed risks, even in the subgroups of women who were considered to be at average risk (for example, who had no family history of BC or who were BRCA1/2 mutation-negative). The AUC performances are summarised in Table\xC2\xA03.Table 3Performance of risk models assessed in at least two modelsRisk model performance (country)GailClausBRCAPRO FordTyrer-CuzickBOADICEAQuante et al.

BOADICEA, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation AlgorithmThe Manchester PROCAS (Predicting Risk Of Cancer At Screening) study has also shown that Tyrer-Cuzick is superior to Gail in predicting which women develop BC (Brentnall et al.; 2015; Development of a mammographic density adjusted Tyrer-Cuzick model in 50,000 women in a general population breast screening population: implications for risk stratified screening; unpublished). Importantly, adding an adjustment for mammographic density increases the identification of women at moderate (4,863, 9.9\xC2\xA0%) and high (1,402, 2.8\xC2\xA0%) risk. The cancer rates in these groups were three and four times higher than the lower-risk groupings. Additionally, rates of higher-stage cancers were further increased, suggesting that targeting these groups would allow prevention of more lethal BCs (Brentnall et al.; 2015; Development of a mammographic density adjusted Tyrer-Cuzick model in 50,000 women in a general population breast screening population: implications for risk stratified screening; unpublished).When is the best opportunity to offer risk assessment?It is difficult to apply the NICE guidelines for additional surveillance or offer of chemoprevention within the National Health Service since there is currently no systematic mechanism for identifying moderate/high-risk women. Many/most moderate/high-risk women remain unaware of their BC risk, and only those women who present with concerns about family history are referred to family history clinics. These women are usually under 50 and are offered additional screening (every 12 to 18\xC2\xA0months) and chemoprevention. The one occasion when all women are invited for a health-related visit that appears to be a good related opportunity is their first invitation for screening mammography. In most countries with national population-based screening programmes, this will be at around age 50.We have undertaken a National Institute for Health Research-funded study (PROCAS) in Greater Manchester, which is investigating the feasibility of assessing and communicating BC risk to women in the NHSBSP [43]. To date, over 57,000 women have been recruited from those invited for mammography (43\xC2\xA0% uptake). Interestingly, 95\xC2\xA0% of recruited women indicated that they wished to know their risk of BC. Since risk is not estimated in the general population, it has not been possible until now to assess the proportion of women in the NHSBSP who are at moderate or high risk by NICE criteria or by models of risk which include factors other than family history.We have shown that, among women entering the PROCAS population-based screening cohort study in Greater Manchester at the age of 46 to 49, 0.7\xC2\xA0% met high-risk and 3.0\xC2\xA0% moderate-risk criteria of the NICE algorithm [44]. Only five (13.5\xC2\xA0%) out of 37 of the BCs would have been identified in 160 women if just these elevated risk women had been screened from age 46\xC2\xA0years onwards [43]. The odds of BCs were 5.7 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 1.9 to 14.7) times higher than 17 (0.6\xC2\xA0%) out of 3,033 of those diagnosed in women with no family history of BC. These finding are at an early stage in follow-up, and more time is required to assess whether with further cancers NICE guidance on extra screening in this age group is justified [7]. The PROCAS study has highlighted a disparity between the NICE algorithm and the 10-year risk thresholds as calculated by Tyrer-Cuzick as 8.8\xC2\xA0% of women would have qualified under the NICE 3\xC2\xA0% 10-year risk threshold of age of 40\xC2\xA0years [44]. This is not surprising as the NICE algorithm was set to identify women on the basis of family history alone who would usually meet the 10-year threshold. The additional numbers identified by Tyrer-Cuzick are of those who, in addition to a less significant family history, had other BC risk factors (nulliparity and late first childbirth) such as in three women who developed BC with a single FDR in their fifties [44].When an adjustment is made to the Tyrer-Cuzick model on the basis of a radiologist\xE2\x80\x99s assessment of percentage breast density on a Visual Analogue Scale, the proportion of women meeting high- and moderate-risk criteria rose to 2.8\xC2\xA0% and 9.9\xC2\xA0%, respectively, in the whole 50,000 population thus far assessed (Evans et al.; 2015; Identifying and informing women at high and low-risk of breast cancer in the general population: risk feedback from the first 50,000 women in the Predicting the Risk of Cancer at Screening (PROCAS) study; unpublished). This stratification accurately identified not only those at higher risk but also those with a higher incidence of high-stage (2b or 3) BCs who might have benefited from more frequent surveillance.The PROCAS study has also already shown that it is feasible to collect questionnaire data from women when they attend the screening episode [43]. We have highlighted that certain questions such as whether a relative has had bilateral BC may need validating and would be suitable for an online questionnaire with a prompting system (Evans et al.; 2015; Identifying and informing women at high and low-risk of breast cancer in the general population: risk feedback from the first 50,000 women in the Predicting the Risk of Cancer at Screening 
2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: (PROCAS) study; unpublished). The PROCAS study has now given risk feedback to nearly 700 women, and 75\xC2\xA0% of those invited at high risk (at least 8\xC2\xA0% 10-year risk) attended a telephone interview or face-to-face appointment. Re-attendance rates increased significantly to 94\xC2\xA0% (229 out of 244) in high-risk women who had been invited for a follow-up 3-year mammogram and were equivalent to usual re-attendance rates in those at low risk (84\xC2\xA0%) (Evans et al.; 2015; Identifying and informing women at high and low-risk of breast cancer in the general population: risk feedback from the first 50,000 women in the Predicting the Risk of Cancer at Screening (PROCAS) study; unpublished).At least two other large studies with aims similar to those of PROCAS are under way. The Karma study in Sweden aims to recruit 100,000 women at their 2-yearly screening appointment [45]. Blood DNA is collected in addition to questionnaire data and mammographic density measurement [45]. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) (Mireille Broeders, personal communication) started recruitment in The Netherlands in 2014 and aims to collect risk factor data on 90,000 screening participants, including 30,000 blood samples.What is the best age to undertake risk assessment?Only 20\xC2\xA0% of BC occurs at ages below 50\xC2\xA0years, when most population-based screening programmes commence. However, 15\xC2\xA0% do occur between the ages of 40 to 50\xC2\xA0years, and women in this age group could benefit from NICE-approved extra surveillance and chemoprevention. Primary care physicians and all others undertaking risk assessment need to be aware that moderate risk can be achieved with less significant family history if there are other adverse risk factors. Around 3.7\xC2\xA0% (95\xC2\xA0% CI 3.1\xC2\xA0% to 4.3\xC2\xA0%) of women in PROCAS at 46 to 49\xC2\xA0years of age would have met NICE moderate/high-risk criteria following the NICE algorithm at 40\xC2\xA0years of age, but this rises to 8.8\xC2\xA0% (95\xC2\xA0% CI 8.0\xC2\xA0% to 9.7\xC2\xA0%) when Tyrer-Cuzick is used (Evans et al.; 2015; Identifying and informing women at high and low-risk of breast cancer in the general population: risk feedback from the first 50,000 women in the Predicting the Risk of Cancer at Screening (PROCAS) study; unpublished). Thus, up to 8.8\xC2\xA0% of the female population in their forties could be offered annual mammography as per moderate-risk screening recommendations and be at least considered for tamoxifen [44]. When expanded to the whole population of PROCAS, 4,225 (8.6\xC2\xA0%) of 49,639 women (thus far evaluated) met moderate-risk criteria, and 597 (1.2\xC2\xA0%) met the 8\xC2\xA0% 10-year risk high-risk criteria. Feedback has been offered to 866 women at high-risk, including those with moderate risk + >60\xC2\xA0% (high) mammographic density (which equates to an 8\xC2\xA0% 10-year risk), and 568 (78.5\xC2\xA0%) of these women have received risk feedback. Two hundred and eighty-three (86\xC2\xA0%) out of 330 of those offered extra interval screening have commenced additional breast screening. Four BCs have now been identified at an early stage on the 18-month mammogram [45].What preventive options should be discussed?LifestyleWomen attending a risk assessment appointment could have a wide-ranging discussion on modifiable BC risks regardless of their actual predicted risk of BC. Some authors have suggested that half of BCs may be prevented by reversing the major modifiable risk factors, including achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, regular physical activity, minimal alcohol intake, and chemoprevention [46]. The risk appointment would be an opportunity to provide health advice related to weight gain, which has a large effect on BC risk as well as other cancers (especially endometrial), diabetes, and heart disease. High-quality observational data show that weight gain in the pre-menopausal period and being overweight or obese after the menopause increase BC risk [46, 47]. A meta-analysis estimated that for each 5-kg/m2 increase in body mass index the risk of BC was increased by 12\xC2\xA0% [48]. Further evidence from two large observational studies indicates that pre- or post-menopausal weight loss reduces post-menopausal BC risk. Sustained weight reduction of 5\xC2\xA0% of body weight in the IOWA Women\xE2\x80\x99s Health Study reduced post-menopausal BC risk by 25\xC2\xA0% to 40\xC2\xA0% compared with women who continued to gain weight [49]. In the Nurses\xE2\x80\x99 Health Study, post-menopausal women who maintained a body weight reduction of 10\xC2\xA0kg or more and did not take hormone replacement therapy had a 50\xC2\xA0% reduction in BC risk [50]. A review of 73 observational studies indicated that moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity reduced the risk of BC by approximately 25\xC2\xA0% in pre- and post-menopausal women compared with inactive women [51]. Alcohol is estimated to increase BC risk by 7\xC2\xA0% to 10\xC2\xA0% for each 10-g increase in daily alcohol intake [35]. The Nurses\xE2\x80\x99 Health Study showed that women who consumed three to six drinks per week were 15\xC2\xA0% more likely to develop BC compared with never-drinkers [52]. On the basis of the evidence available, all women could be advised at a risk evaluation at their screening appointment to maintain a healthy weight or lose weight if overweight, to take regular exercise, and to minimize alcohol intake.ChemopreventionThere have been nine randomised trials of SERMs [13] and two trials of aromatase inhibitors [53, 54]. These have been carried out mainly in women at increased risk of BC, but one trial was in women with osteoporosis and another in women with or at high risk of diabetes or heart disease (raloxifene). In the SERM trials, 83,399 participants were included, with more than 300,000\xC2\xA0years of follow-up over an average period of 65\xC2\xA0months. The overall reduction in BC (including ductal carcinoma in situ) using tamoxifen 20\xC2\xA0mg per day was 38\xC2\xA0% (P\xE2\x80\x89<\xE2\x80\x890.0001) [13], and estimated reduction in 10-year cumulative BC incidence ranged from 6.3\xC2\xA0% in the control group to 4.2\xC2\xA0% in the SERM groups. On the basis of this evidence, NICE approved the use of both tamoxifen and raloxifene (post-menopausal only) for prevention of BC in women at familial risk [7]. When compared in a randomised trial, tamoxifen was significantly superior to raloxifene in longer-term follow-up for preventing invasive BC (relative risk raloxifene/tamoxifen 1:24, 95\xC2\xA0% CI 1.05 to 1.47), but raloxifene was associated with fewer side effects, particularly with respect to the uterus, and may be preferable in post-menopausal women [14]. A recent analysis of the IBIS I tamoxifen prevention trial indicated that the reduction of risk lasted up to 15\xC2\xA0years after the 5-year treatment with tamoxifen [55].Aromatase inhibitors given after surgery to prevent BC relapse are generally superior to tamoxifen. This led to the initiation of two placebo-controlled trials in post-menopausal women at increased risk of BC. One tested exemestane and reported a 65\xC2\xA0% reduction in BC risk after 5\xC2\xA0years of treatment [53]. In the other trial (IBIS II), anastrozole was compared with placebo [54]. In total, 3,864 post-menopausal women who were between 40 and 70\xC2\xA0years old and at increased risk of BC were randomly assigned. The first report indicated that BC incidence was reduced by 53\xC2\xA0% (hazard risk 0.47, 95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.32 to 0.68) by use of anastrozole. Compared with SERMs, aromatase inhibitors are not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic disease and uterine problems, including cancer, but are associated with increased mild to moderate bone/muscle pain and reduced bone density.Unfortunately, the IBIS II study was not available for NICE guidance and therefore aromatase inhibitor use in the UK would be without the current backing of NICE. Clearly, for chemoprevention to have a major impact on BC incidence, high levels of uptake would be required although potentially more than 20\xC2\xA0% of BCs could be targeted [44].ConclusionsThe first mammography screening appointment at 47 to 50\xC2\xA0years of age provides an ideal teachable moment to assess BC risk and inform women of lifestyle and other measures to reduce BC risk. In the future, this may also allow the introduction of risk-stratified screening which already exists to some extent in many screening programmes; the NHSBSP has already introduced very high-risk screening with MRI mainly in women with mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or TP53. The PROCAS study has shown that it is feasible to collect risk information and, using a good discriminating risk model, provide accurate assessments of women\xE2\x80\x99s risk of BC, although further improvements in risk discrimination are needed. These models should ideally be adapted to include mammographic density information and potentially common genetic risk modifiers (SNPs). The screening appointment would provide an opportunity to help reduce disease burden from not only BC but other common diseases. It appears that the great majority of women wish to know their risk, although this would need to be validated by inviting whole populations to an opt-in or -out risk assessment rather than seeking consent for a research study. More widespread introduction of chemoprevention, using tamoxifen in pre-menopausal women and raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors in post-menopausal women, could substantially reduce BC incidence, although uptake rates would need to rise above the approximately 10\xC2\xA0% seen in most studies [56]. Further research would be required to determine whether women need to be reassessed at least at one further time point to determine changes to risk related to menopausal status, mammographic density, and other changes to risk factors.

There are various areas where clinical research is active, including benign tumours and risk factors for malignant transformation, biological evolution of normal and cancerous cells, prevention, screening, diagnosis, therapeutic strategies, rehabilitation and maintenance of quality of life.This document concerns the diagnosis and therapeutic management of nonmetastatic breast cancer, and does not cover screening or prevention. This is a summary of an update (Mauriac et al, 2001) of the version published in 1996 (Mauriac et al, 1996), in which sections concerning some particular situations and in situ carcinomas have not been included (these will be covered in a specific document). In addition, breast cancer with a genetic predisposition (BRCAX) will not be specifically covered in this document.METHODSThe \xE2\x80\x98Standards, Options and Recommendations\xE2\x80\x99 (SOR) project, which started in 1993, involves a collaboration between the Federation of French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), the 20 French Regional Cancer Centres, several French public university and general hospitals, private clinics and cancer-learned societies. The main objective of the SOR project is to develop clinical practice guidelines which can be used to improve the quality of health care and outcomes for cancer patients. The methodology is based on a literature review, followed by critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts to produce draft guidelines which are then validated by specialists in cancer-care delivery. The details of the methodology used for developing these SOR have been described previously (Fervers et al, 2001).A multidisciplinary working group was set up by the FNCLCC. References to pertinent articles were identified by the global bibliographic monitoring process of MEDLINE, set up in 1996 and by specific searches in other databases such as Embase\xC2\xAE, Cancerlit\xC2\xAE and the Cochrane Library\xC2\xAE, and from the personal reference lists of the members of the working group. In addition, the French National Agency for Health Accreditation and Evaluation (ANAES) provided a complementary updated bibliographic search (1999 to October 2000). After selection and critical appraisal of these articles, the members of the working group drafted the SORs.\xE2\x80\x98Standards\xE2\x80\x99 identify clinical situations for which there exist strong indications or contraindications for a particular intervention and \xE2\x80\x98Options\xE2\x80\x99 identify situations for which there are several alternatives, none of which have shown clear superiority over the others (Table 1Table 1Definition of \xE2\x80\x98Standards, Options and Recommendations\xE2\x80\x99StandardsProcedures or treatments which are considered to be of benefit, inappropriate or harmful by unanimous decision based on the best available evidence\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0OptionsProcedures or treatments which are considered to be of benefit, inappropriate or harmful by a majority, based on the best available evidence\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0RecommendationsAdditional information to enable the available options to be ranked using expect criteria (e.g. survival, toxicity) with an indication of the level of evidence). In any SOR, there can be several \xE2\x80\x98Options\xE2\x80\x99 for a given clinical situation. \xE2\x80\x98Recommendations\xE2\x80\x99 enable the \xE2\x80\x98Options\xE2\x80\x99 to be weighed according to the available evidence. Several interventions can be recommended for the same clinical situation, so that clinicians can make a choice according to specific clinical parameters, for example, local circumstances, skills, equipment, resources and patient preferences. Adapting the SORs to a local situation is possible if the reason for the choice is sufficiently transparent and this is crucial for successful implementation. Inclusion of patients in clinical trials is an appropriate form of patient management in oncology and is recommended frequently within the SORs, particularly in situations where evidence is too weak to support an intervention.The type of evidence underlying any \xE2\x80\x98Standard\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98Option\xE2\x80\x99 or \xE2\x80\x98Recommendation\xE2\x80\x99, is indicated using a classification developed by the FNCLCC based on previously published models. The level of evidence depends not only on the type and quality of the studies reviewed, but also on the concordance of the results (Table 2Table 2Definition of level of evidenceLevel AThere exists a high standard meta-analysis or several high-standard randomised clinical trials which give consistent results\xC2\xA0Level BThere exists good quality evidence from randomised trials (B1) or prospective or retrospective studies (B2).

When no clear scientific evidence exists, judgement is made according to the professional experience and consensus of the expert group (\xE2\x80\x98expert agreement\xE2\x80\x99).The document containing the SORs was then reviewed by a group of independent experts (see the appendix) and after taking into consideration their comments, the guidelines were validated by the working group.This document summarises the key recommendations from the complete updated edition that has been published in French as a monograph (Mauriac, et al, 2001) and a French summary version (Mauriac et al, 2002) and is also available at the Internet address: http://www.fnclcc.fr.CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS (FIGURE 1 AND FIGURE 2)Diagnostic work-up of an abnormality in the breastClinical examinationFigure 1Diagnosis\xE2\x80\x93clinically detectable breast abnormality.Figure 2diagnosis\xE2\x80\x93impalpable mammographic abnormality.In patients with locally and regionally advanced disease, clinical examination is likely to be of greater diagnostic value than in patients with less advanced disease (standard). Tumours with the following characteristics are unlikely to be operable, and are associated with a poor short-term prognosis: inflammatory change, deep extension, lymphadenopathy, breast oedema and/or lymphoedema in the upper limbs. These factors also indicate an increased risk of locoregional and metastatic recurrence (standard). Thus, nonoperability is not always due to difficulties associated with the surgery itself. Surgery may still be appropriate, however, to achieve local control, despite a poor prognosis. Imaging can be used to confirm findings from clinical examination. In some cases, clinical examination will be normal, so that the diagnosis will only be possible following imaging (standard).Diagnostic imagingA standard bilateral mammogram with two views (front and external oblique), can be complemented by other views and by ultrasonography (standard). The equipment used for mammography should undergo regular quality control (standard). To confirm the diagnosis, additional views and enlargements may be necessary (option).Specific imaging is not indicated in the examination of lymphadenopathy. Standard reporting of mammograms should be used in which the stated diagnosis is based on the mammographic features suspicious of malignancy using the American College of Radiology classification (recommendation).The diagnostic findings should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team. When the level of suspicion from imaging justifies histological verification, this should be done using interventional breast diagnostic techniques in an outpatient setting under a local anaesthetic.Pretreatment diagnosisThe diagnosis of malignancy can be obtained from cytology (fine-needle aspiration) or tissue sample (core biopsy), whereas the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma can only be made from a biopsy sample (standard).The histological diagnosis of impalpable lesions should be compared with the diagnostic hypotheses generated from diagnostic imaging (recommendation). The diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical hyperplasia from a needle biopsy sample should always be reconfirmed using a sample obtained by surgical excision (recommendation, level of evidence: B1). Regular assessment of the diagnostic performance of image-guided biopsy systems is recommended (recommendation, expert agreement).PATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION AND CLASSIFICATIONFrozen sectionsExamination of frozen sections is not indicated for isolated clusters of microcalcification or for a tumour measuring less than 10\xE2\x80\x89mm (standard). It is indicated in other cases where it is likely to modify the surgical plan (standard). This examination should not jeopardise the quality of the excised sample and therefore the reliability of the final histological diagnosis (standard).Surgic
2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: al marginsThe standard histological report should mention the findings from the diagnostic work-up and all factors necessary for establishing the prognosis:\\nthe size of the malignant lesion(s) (in mm);the histological type;the histological grade (specifying the grading system used);the percentage of any ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS);the presence of peritumoral vascular invasion;the status of the surgical margins, including that of all additional excised samples.For an invasive tumour, the measurement of the infiltrating component should be given, including data from macroscopic and microscopic examinations (recommendation). The overall size of the lesions (including the invasive component and any associated intraductal component) can be documented (option, expert agreement).If there is intraductal carcinoma only, the size of the lesions should be assessed by combining the findings from the radiological and histopathological examinations (recommendation). If this assessment is difficult (multiple foci, etc.), the number of \xE2\x80\x98positive\xE2\x80\x99 sections out of the total number of sections examined should be stated (recommendation, expert agreement).The quality of the excised sample is defined by two criteria (recommendation):\\nthe distance (in mm) between all malignant foci and the nearest excision margin (identified using surgical guide marks);the nature of the tumour lesion (invasive or intraductal) nearest to the surgical margin.In cases where the surgical margin is invaded by tumour, the extent of this should be specified (recommendation, expert agreement).MastectomyThe standard histological report for a mastectomy sample should state the details of the diagnostic work-up and those factors required to establish the prognosis:\\nthe sites and number of malignant lesions;the size of the malignant lesions (in mm);the histological type of the tumour;the histological grade (specifying the grading system used);the percentage of DCIS, if present;the presence of peritumoral vascular invasion;the presence of extension into the nipple (specifying position and type: intraductal, infiltrating, Paget's disease);the presence if any of cutaneous or pectoralis major fasciomuscular involvement.For an invasive tumour, the extent of the invasive component should be given, integrating data from macroscopic and microscopic examinations (recommendation). The overall extent of the lesions (including the invasive component and any associated intraductal component) can be documented (option, expert agreement).If there is intraductal carcinoma only, the size of the lesions should be assessed by integrating the data from radiological and microscopic examinations (recommendation). If this assessment is difficult (multiple foci, etc.), the number of \xE2\x80\x98positive\xE2\x80\x99 sections out of the total number of sections examined should be given (recommendation, expert agreement).Axillary dissectionAll lymph nodes removed by axillary dissection should undergo full histological examination using a series of macroscopic sections (standard).The standard histological report for the samples from axillary dissection should specify:\\nthe number of lymph nodes examined;the number of metastatic lymph nodes, including the presence of micrometastases and if a sentinel node biopsy was performed before axillary dissection (standard);the number of metastatic lymph nodes with capsular rupture.Optimal quality for axillary examination requires sampling from at least 10 lymph nodes (standard, level of evidence: B1). This is usually achieved by a level I/II axillary dissection (standard, level of evidence: B1). Surgical guide marks should be made to orientate the sample, at least at one end (standard). The technique of sentinel node biopsy may avoid axillary dissection in 85\xE2\x80\x9390% of patients without lymph node involvement (level of evidence: B1), but cannot be recommended until the results of ongoing studies are available (recommendation, expert agreement). This technique requires input from a multidisciplinary team experienced in the area (recommendation, level of evidence: B1).Histological classification of breast cancerThe standard histological classification of breast cancer is that developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) (standard). The standard for histo-prognostic grading is that developed by Elston and Ellis (standard). This is applicable to all invasive cancers with the exception of medullary carcinomas and in situ carcinomas (standard). The coding of lesions can be performed using the CIMO/SNOMED system (WHO classification) and/or the ADICAP system (French classification) (option).INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE DETECTION OF METASTATIC DISEASEThere is no indication to undertake a metastatic screening before the confirmation of a diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma (standard). This is also true for in situ carcinomas (standard).If a mastectomy is planned, a metastatic screening should be performed prior to surgery to avoid unnecessary surgery in women who already have metastatic disease, even if the probability is low (recommendation). In the absence of symptoms, a metastatic screening should only be performed after evaluation of the metastatic risk factors (see section on Prognostic factors) (recommendation). Assays of CA 15.3 and other tumour markers should not be done during the initial work-up because of their low sensitivity (standard, level of evidence: B2). At a more advanced stage of disease, they are often elevated but have no diagnostic value. Tumour markers can sometimes be used as a reference when poor prognostic factors are present (option). No study has shown an independent prognostic value for tumour markers. Nonspecific markers, such as CA 125, CA19-9 and TPA, should not be assayed (standard).PROGNOSTIC FACTORSPredictive factors for lymph node involvementIt is essential to perform a clinical examination of the axillary region even though it is imprecise (standard, level of evidence: B1). Lymph node involvement generally progresses towards the apex of the axilla (standard, level of evidence: B1). Tumour size is the principal risk factor for lymph node involvement (standard, level of evidence: B1). Histologically confirmed axillary involvement, tumour size and young age are the main predictive factors for internal mammary node involvement (standard, level of evidence: B2). The influence of the tumour site is controversial.Predictive factors for local breast recurrenceThe most important clinical factors are young age (under 35 or 40 years old) and premenopausal status. The most important histological factors are: positive excision margins and the presence of an extensive ductal in situ component associated with the invasive component, high-grade tumour, the presence of peritumoral vascular invasion and inappropriate treatment.Predictive factors for metastatic diseaseThe most important clinical factors are young age (under 35 or 40 years old), tumour size and axillary node involvement. The histological factors with the strongest prognostic value are tumour size, histologically confirmed node involvement, the number of axillary nodes involved (\xE2\xA9\xBE4), a high-grade tumour and positive excision margins. The presence of peritumoral vascular invasion is also a predictive factor for metastatic disease.Predictive factors for therapeutic responseHormone receptor status should be determined in all cases of invasive disease (standard), using either a biochemical or immunohistochemical method (standard). The analysis for overexpression of c-erbB-2 should not be performed on a routine basis (standard). The predictive factors for response to chemotherapy, including c-erbB-2, are in the process of being evaluated. Cellular proliferation should be assessed in all infiltrating tumours, using either the mitotic index, S phase fraction measurement or Ki67 immunohistochemical assay (recommendation, expert agreement). Quality control is mandatory in all laboratories irrespective of the prognostic test performed (standard).TREATMENT MODALITIESSurgeryIrrespective of the surgical technique used, tumour excision should be complete with negative margins and should be adapted to the tumour size and the breast volume (standard). The optimal size of excision to ensure negative margins has not been defined (standard).When breast-conserving surgery is to be undertaken, the aesthetic result should be acceptable to the patient (standard). Central tumours can be treated in a conservative manner if excision is complete (sometimes requiring excision of the nipple\xE2\x80\x93areolar complex) (option).Modified radical mastectomy is equivalent to radical mastectomy in terms of local control and survival (standard). Breast-conserving treatments with lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy are equivalent to mastectomy in terms of local recurrence and survival (standard, level of evidence: A). Subcutaneous mastectomy should not be considered for invasive or noninvasive breast cancer (recommendation, expert agreement).Complications after axillary node dissectionThere appears to be no technique available to assess the risk of sequelae (particularly lymphoedema) following surgery to this anatomically complex and strategic area where several different lymphatic regions converge (back, legs, anterior thoracic wall and breast). Early physiotherapy for the shoulder and the thoracic wall is by far the most significant preventative treatment. Informing patients of the best means of prevention remains the best means of preventing lymphoedema. Lymphatic drainage is not indicated as a preventative measure (recommendation).RadiotherapyRadiotherapy reduces the risk of mortality due to breast cancer (standard, level of evidence: A). However, it may increase the risk of long-term cardiovascular mortality if an inappropriate technique is used. Breast, chest wall or lymph node irradiation should be performed with caution, with the aim of limiting the irrad

The dose prescription is standardised (the International Commission on Radiation Units (ICRU)) (standard, level of evidence: A).After breast-conserving surgery, breast radiotherapy should always be performed, using a minimum dose of 50\xE2\x80\x89Gy in 25 fractions (standard, level of evidence: A). Breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery significantly reduces the risk of local recurrence irrespective of the initial disease stage (standard, level of evidence: A). In women under 50 years old, a boost should be administered routinely to the tumour bed even when the margins are clear (standard, level of evidence: B). Guidelines from an expert committee of the French Society of Oncological Radiotherapy (SFRO, 1991) cover the choice of target volume for irradiation following breast-conserving surgery. After mastectomy, the benefit from chest wall radiotherapy is greater in patients with the highest number of risk factors (standard, level of evidence: A).Irradiation of the internal mammary lymph nodes is indicated in all cases of axillary lymph node involvement (standard, level of evidence: B1) and when the tumour is medial or central (standard, expert agreement). Irradiation of the infra- and supraclavicular lymph nodes is indicated in the presence of axillary lymph node involvement (standard, level of evidence: B1). The omission of lymph node irradiation, as defined above, is only justified in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (standard, expert agreement).The choice of immediate breast reconstruction should not jeopardise the optimal use of locoregional radiotherapy and systemic treatment (recommendation). After axillary dissection, radiotherapy to the axilla should be avoided as much as possible because of the increased risk of locoregional complications (standard, level of evidence: C).ChemotherapyAnthracycline-containing polychemotherapy is currently the most commonly used regimen in France and is more efficacious than the CMF regimen: cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (5-FU) (standard, level of evidence: A). This is supported by the conclusions from the NIH consensus conference (NIH, 2000).Adjuvant chemotherapy improves progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with node-positive breast cancer and in certain patients without node involvement. Premenopausal women seem to benefit more than menopausal women.Doxorubicin, epirubicin, 5-FU, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate used in combination every 3\xE2\x80\x934 weeks, with a maximum of six cycles, is the reference treatment. The optimal number of cycles (four to six cycles) is unknown. Chemotherapy should be started promptly. The efficacy of perioperative chemotherapy has not been clearly proved, and should only be undertaken in the setting of a randomised clinical trial. High-dose chemotherapy, with or without stem cell infusion, is under evaluation and cannot be considered as a therapeutic standard. The optimal dose for epirubicin remains to be determined. Taxanes have not yet been shown to offer any benefit as adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment.Induction or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an option in operable breast cancer where first-line breast-conserving surgery is not possible, in the absence of multifocal lesions, and where the patient would prefer breast conservation (option). Compared with adjuvant therapy, induction or neoadjuvant therapy has no effect on survival but has been shown to avoid mastectomy in more than 50% of women. The risk of local recurrence is higher than with a primary mastectomy and the possibility of breast-conserving surgery is reduced. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, locoregional treatment should be performed in the same manner as that used for first-line locoregional treatment (standard).In premenopausal women, the combination of hormone therapy with adjuvant chemotherapy does not lead to a significant improvement in global survival or progression-free survival. This may be due to the low number of young women treated with tamoxifen and/or the lack of stratification for hormone receptor status in previous studies (standard, level of evidence: A). However, the practice was recommended in November 2000 by the NIH consensus conference (NIH, 2000).Hormone therapyTreatment with adjuvant tamoxifen is beneficial, despite its side effects, irrespective of the patients\xE2\x80\x99 age, if the tumour expresses oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). Tamoxifen should not be prescribed to women with tumours that do not express oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). The optimal duration for adjuvant hormone therapy with tamoxifen is 5 years at a dose of 20\xE2\x80\x89mg\xE2\x80\x89day\xE2\x88\x921 (standard, level of evidence: A). Patients treated with tamoxifen should have regular gynaecological clinical examinations (recommendation, expert agreement). Additional examinations are not necessary in the absence of symptoms.Neoadjuvant treatment with antioestrogens can be used in elderly women with slowly evolving hormone-sensitive tumours (option, level of evidence: B1). This should be followed when possible by optimal locoregional treatment (option, expert agreement). At present, antioestrogens cannot be considered as standard neoadjuvant treatment for initially operable tumours.Hormone therapy can be administered for different reasons, depending on the patients\xE2\x80\x99 age:\\nsuppression of ovarian function in women with ovarian activity and/or as an antioestrogen,antioestrogenic therapy in postmenopausal women.In postmenopausal women, the combination of chemotherapy with an antioestrogen significantly improves progression-free survival and overall survival (standard, level of evidence: A). The ratio of efficacy (overall or recurrence-free survival) and risk (toxicity) should be considered when taking the decision to prescribe this combination. The efficacy/risk ratio favours treatment in women with major metastatic risk factors (recommendation, expert agreement).Other hormone therapy (progestogens, aromatase inhibitors) should not be considered as adjuvant treatments except in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (standard).Breast reconstruction and additional treatmentsWhen mastectomy is necessary to obtain local control and the patient would prefer immediate breast reconstruction, multidisciplinary consultation is essential to assess the need for locoregional (irradiation) or systemic (chemotherapy or hormone therapy) treatment. Breast reconstruction is not a cancer treatment but is an integral component of breast cancer care (standard). It can be performed immediately or be delayed, but should never interfere with the administration of other treatments (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) (standard). Poor prognosis is not a contraindication for breast reconstruction (standard). However, the patient's performance status and/or a high risk of recurrence of the disease can be relative contraindications (standard). The patient should participate in the final decision (standard). There are three main techniques for reconstruction: submuscular inplant, latissimus dorsi flap or TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) pedicle flaps and microanastomosed free flaps (option).If the patient requires radiotherapy but wants immediate breast reconstruction, autologous tissue techniques should be used. A prosthesis can be irradiated but the patient should be informed about the potential risks, particularly that of substantial contraction as seen in about 50% of patients.TREATMENT STRATEGYThe patient should participate in her treatment decisions at every stage.Treatment evaluationTreatment evaluation involves both functional and aesthetic evaluation, consideration of possible side effects and the patients\xE2\x80\x99 quality of life (standard). Painful scarring (leading to limited mobility of the arm/shoulder) and lymphoedema are the most frequently observed complications after surgery. The aesthetic result depends on the quality of the surgery and radiotherapy technique (standard). Aesthetic problems do not occur following chemotherapy alone, but are observed when chemotherapy is used concomitantly with radiotherapy (standard). Visual analogue scales of well being are useful for assessing quality of life. Fatigue has a significant impact on quality of life and can be related to treatment and/or a depressive reaction. This should always be taken into consideration by the physician and its importance should not be underrated. Questionnaires exist for assessing fatigue and quality of life (standard).Locoregional treatmentSurgery and/or radiotherapy are used for the locoregional control of the disease.Management of impalpable tumoursThe therapeutic strategy for ductal carcinomas in situ is not covered in this document. The therapeutic management of impalpable tumours is often a stepwise process guided by the histological results of the previous intervention. The patient should be informed right from the start about the risks associated with repeated interventions.\\nFirst decisional step (Figure 3): This first step is diagnostic and potentially therapeutic and consists of a radiologically proven complete excision and histological analysis of the lesion (standard). In the absence of a palpable macroscopic lesion, a frozen section and primary axillary dissection should not be performed (recommendation, expert agreement). If microcalcifications are present, a mammogram should be performed 2 months after surgery (recommendation, expert agreement).Second decisional step: This step depends on the status of the surgical margins and the extent of the microcalcification before and/or after surgery.\\n\xE2\x97\x8B Microinvasive cancer (infiltrating component \xE2\xA9\xBD2\xE2\x80\x89mm): There is no specific data concerning the risk of progression of microinvasive cancers. The recommendations are 
2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: the same as those proposed for invasive cancers (Figure 4).\\n\xE2\x80\x93 Extensive microcalcifications at diagnosis (breast-conserving surgery inappropriate): Modified radical mastectomy followed by immediate breast reconstruction should be offered (standard).\xE2\x80\x93 Clear margins and no residual microcalcifications: The breast should be irradiated (standard). Modified radical mastectomy can be considered if the patient refuses conservative treatment (option). Axillary dissection or axillary radiotherapy may also be performed (option). In the absence of known risk factors for metastatic recurrence, adjuvant systemic treatment should not be given (recommendation, level of evidence: B).\xE2\x80\x93 Involved margins and/or residual microcalcifications: Mastectomy is the standard treatment (standard). Re-excision and breast radiotherapy, or axillary dissection and radiotherapy can be performed (option). If re-excision does not provide clear margins, mastectomy should be performed (standard).\xE2\x97\x8B Invasive cancer (Figure 5):\\n\xE2\x80\x93 Extensive micro-calcifications at diagnosis: Modified radical mastectomy is indicated (standard). In the event of lymph node invasion, radiotherapy to the chest wall and lymph nodes (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) should be performed (standard).\xE2\x80\x93 Clear margins and/or absence of residual microcalcifications: The standard procedure is axillary dissection and breast radiotherapy (standard). If the patient presents with lymph node involvement, this should be followed by lymph node irradiation (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) (standard). It is also possible to irradiate the lymph nodes without axillary surgery (option).\xE2\x80\x93 Invaded margins and/or presence of residual microcalcifications: Modified radical mastectomy should be performed (standard). In the event of lymph node involvement, this should be followed by the chest wall and lymph nodes (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) irradiation (standard). Re-excision combined with axillary dissection, followed by breast radiotherapy can be undertaken. Breast radiotherapy with a boost to the tumour bed can also be considered (option).Management of a single, palpable, Localised tumour treatable by breast-conserving surgeryA single palpable localised tumour can be completely excised with a wide margin (Figure 6Figure 3Impalpable operable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.Figure 4Operable impalpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.Figure 5Operable impalpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.Figure 6Operable palpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.). This is dependent on the probability of achieving an excision with clear margins and a satisfactory aesthetic result.First decision step (Figure 7Figure 7Operable palpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.): Lumpectomy (\xC2\xB1frozen section), axillary dissection and breast radiotherapy is the standard. The breast should always be irradiated; this has been shown to reduce considerably the rate of local recurrence (recommendation, level of evidence. A). Axillary dissection should only be undertaken after the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma has been confirmed (recommendation, expert agreement). It is essential to examine all tissue margins (recommendation). Central tumours can be managed with conservative treatment (recommendation, expert agreement). If the patient refuses conservative treatment, a modified radical mastectomy can be considered (option). If microcalcifications are present, a postoperative mammogram is essential to verify the presence or absence of residual lesions after conservative treatment (standard, expert agreement).Second decision step (Figure 8Figure 8Operable palpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.): This step follows conservative treatment and depends on the histological status of the tissue margins and the presence of other risk factors.\\n\xE2\x97\x8B Clear excision margins (Figure 8): Whole breast radiotherapy should be performed (standard) with an additional dose to the tumour bed (boost) if the patient is under 50 years old (standard). This association can be given to patients over 50 years old who have other risk factors for recurrence (option).\xE2\x97\x8B Positive excision margins (Figure 9Figure 9Operable palpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.)\\n\xE2\x80\x93 When re-excision is possible (histologically clear margins possible and a satisfactory aesthetic result). The standard procedure is to undertake re-excision and breast radiotherapy (standard). This should be followed by a boost to the tumour bed if the patient is under 50 years old (standard) or has other risk factors (option).\\nIf a boost to the tumour bed and/or re-excision is performed, the aesthetic result should be satisfactory (recommendation, expert agreement). If the patient refuses re-excision, breast radiotherapy with a boost to the tumour bed can be considered (option). Modified radical mastectomy can also be considered (option).\xE2\x80\x93 When re-excision is impossible (the margins will be involved after re-excision, and/or the aesthetic result will not be satisfactory). Modified radical mastectomy should be performed (standard). Immediate breast reconstruction can be considered if there are no other risk factors for locoregional recurrence and/or this does not prejudice the administration of additional treatment (option)..If the patient refuses mastectomy and there is a high risk of metastatic recurrence or if there is minimal invasion of the excised tissue margins, breast radiotherapy and a boost to the tumour bed can be proposed (option, level of evidence: D).Third decision step (Figure 10Figure 10Operable tumour\xE2\x80\x93indication for nodal radiotherapy.): This depends on the extent of axillary node involvement.\\n\xE2\x97\x8B Absence of axillary node involvement: The decision depends on the tumour localisation.\\n\xE2\x80\x93 Lateral tumour\xE2\x80\x83The nodal areas should not be irradiated (standard).\xE2\x80\x93 Central and/or medial tumour\xE2\x80\x83The internal mammary chain should be irradiated (standard). Infra- and supraclavicular radiotherapy can also be considered (option). Nodal irradiation for low-risk tumours is not recommended, and is currently under evaluation.\\n\xE2\x80\x93 Irrespective of the tumour localisation, axillary radiotherapy should not be performed in the absence of histologically proven nodal involvement (recommendation, level of evidence: A).\xE2\x97\x8B Presence of axillary node involvement: Screen for distant metastases (standard) and irradiate infra- and supraclavicular plus internal mammary nodes (standard). If extensive nodal involvement is present, the whole of the axillary region can be irradiated (option). Radiotherapy should only be omitted in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (option).Palpable tumour, primary breast-conserving surgery not possibleFirst decision step: A metastatic screen should be undertaken (standard) (Figure 11Figure 11Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible.). A modified radical mastectomy should be performed in the absence of metastases (standard). Nonsurgical treatment (medical or radiotherapy) can be considered (option). Nonsurgical treatment is not indicated for multifoci lesions where the local treatment should be mastectomy (recommendation, expert agreement). If primary radiotherapy or medical treatment is performed, locoregional control must be obtained (recommendation, level of evidence: A) (Figure 12Figure 12Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible\xE2\x80\x93local treatment after neoadjuvant radiotherapy.).\\nA preliminary biopsy can be performed to assess the prognostic factors that are necessary to guide locoregional and adjuvant treatment (recommendation, expert agreement). When immediate reconstruction is offered, it should not jeopardise the administration of locoregional and/or systemic treatment (recommendation).Second decision step (Figure 13Figure 13Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible: modified radical mastectomy.): This step occurs after mastectomy and axillary dissection and is dependent on the presence or absence of risk factors for local recurrence.\\n\xE2\x97\x8B Absence of risk factors for local recurrence: Chest wall radiotherapy is not indicated (standard).\xE2\x97\x8B Presence of risk factors for local recurrence: Chest wall radiotherapy is indicated (standard).Third decision step (Figure 10): This step is dependent on the extent of axillary node involvement (see section on \xE2\x80\x98Management of a single palpable localised tumour treatable by breast-conserving surgery, third decision step\xE2\x80\x99).Adjuvant therapy (Figure 14)Figure 14Operable tumour\xE2\x80\x93adjuvant treatment.The aim of adjuvant therapy is to reduce the risk of metastatic recurrence and thus improve survival. Risk factors for metastatic recurrence should be assessed during the initial examination and from the histopathological examination of surgical specimens. Adjuvant therapy should not replace optimal locoregional treatment. The patient's menopausal status and the tumour hormone receptor status should be used in the selection of one of the reference treatments: hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy.Adjuvant therapy after surgery and initial axillary dissection with the possibility of breast conservationThe standards, options and recommendations are summarised in Table 3Table 3Management of patients with breast cancer with lymph node involvement (N+ve)\xC2\xA0Premenopaual woman or \xE2\xA9\xBD50 years old (Figure 16)Post menopausal woman or >50 years old (Figure 17)\xC2\xA0ER+veER\xE2\x88\x92ve or unknownER+ve or unknownER\xE2\x88\x92veStandardsChemotherapy and tamoxifenChemotherapy, no hormone therapyTamoxifenNo standard\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0OptionsChemotherapy and ovarian suppression \xC2

Hormone therapy with tamoxifen can be given if the tumour is positive (or unknown) for oestrogen receptors (option) (Figure 19Figure 19Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible\xE2\x80\x93local treatment after neoadjuvant treatment.).Adjuvant therapy after first-line radiotherapyThe size of the initial lesion may justify the use of adjuvant medical therapy (recommendation) (Figure 20Figure 20Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible\xE2\x80\x93local treatment after neoadjuvant radiotherapy.).FOLLOW-UPFollow-up should focus on the evaluation of the treatment results, screening for relapse, treatment of side effects and psychosocial and professional rehabilitation (Figure 21Figure 21Standard follow-up.). This requires a multidisciplinary approach.Follow-up of the conserved breastClinical examination should be performed 4 months after treatment to assess treatment toxicity (standard). Clinical follow-up should then be repeated every 6 months for 5 years and then yearly for 10 years (standard). Routine follow-up should be continued after 10 years, but the timing can be adjusted depending on the risk of local recurrence (option). An annual mammogram should be performed starting 6 months after treatment (standard).Follow-up of the chest and lymph node areasRoutine clinical examination forms the basis of follow-up for the thoracic wall and the lymph node areas after treatment for breast cancer.Follow-up of the contralateral breastClinical examination and a mammogram should be performed at the same frequency as above for the follow-up of the conserved breast (standard, expert agreement).General follow-up after treatment of patients in complete remissionHistory taking and clinical examination form the basis of follow-up (standard). In the absence of symptoms or signs, a routine screen for metastases is not indicated (standard, level of evidence: A). If a metastasis is found, the patient should undergo a full work-up (recommendation, expert agreement). The frequency of general clinical follow-up is the same as that for locoregional follow-up (recommendation, expert agreement).Rehabilitation after treatment for breast cancerRehabilitation should start before treatment with clear specific information about possible post-treatment complications and how they can be prevented and/or managed (standard). Functional problems of arm or shoulder movement require early physiotherapy (standard). Lymphoedema can be treated with physical methods and systemic therapy (recommendation). Coumarin is no longer indicated because of its toxicity and lack of efficacy (standard).To avoid weight gain, dietary advice should be provided routinely (recommendation). Sexual problems should be evaluated and treated (recommendation). The need for contraception and family planning advice should be discussed individually taking into consideration each patient's preference (recommendation).Hormone replacement treatment for postmenopausal symptoms should not be prescribed after treatment for breast cancer, except in specific cases. The prescription of hormone replacement treatment after breast cancer is being evaluated prospectively. Nonhormonal treatments exist for the various symptoms (recommendation).Psychological support may well be required at some stage during the management process (option). Social support, to strengthen the psychological support, should be provided routinely to help patients and their families (option). Patient rehabilitation groups can contribute to the psychosocial support of patients (option).Management of patients with recurrent diseaseManagement of local recurrence after breast-conserving treatment for breast cancerLocal recurrence should be treated with surgery. Radiotherapy should not be considered except in specific cases (standard). The standard treatment is a simple total mastectomy (standard). Immediate reconstruction can be considered (option). If oestrogen receptors are present, additional hormone therapy is recommended (recommendation).Breast-conserving surgery can only be considered if the patient refuses mastectomy or if mastectomy is technically impossible. In this case, the patient should be informed of the high risk of recurrent disease (recommendation). As the efficacy of additional chemotherapy is unknown, this should only be considered in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (recommendation, expert agreement).Management of uncontrolled, isolated local recurrence (inflammatory or locally advanced tumour)There is no standard (standard). Chemotherapy can be considered, followed if possible, by local treatment that may or may not be curative (options). Local treatment (surgery and/or radiotherapy) for symptom control can also be considered (option).Chemotherapy is appropriate for an inflammatory recurrence. Radiotherapy can be considered if there are contraindications for chemotherapy (option). When possible, mastectomy should be performed for a locally advanced recurrence (option). If this is not possible, chemotherapy or radiotherapy should be given with the aim of making the lesion operable (option). Irrespective of the treatments administered, the indications for additional medical treatment will be the same as those for potentially curable isolated recurrences (recommendation, expert agreement).\",\"id\":\"0db6af7a-bf29-43a5-b845-f7c660b7c021\",\"_version_\":1534947704183980032},{\"nlmTa\":\"Hered Cancer Clin Pract\",\"all\":[\"Hered Cancer Clin Pract\",\"1731-2302\",\"2008-6-15\",\"BioMed Central\",\"\",\"19804604\",\"2735784\",\"Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\",\"6\",\"2\",\"88\",\"98\"],\"ppub\":\"1731-2302\",\"epub\":\"2008-6-15\",\"publisherName\":\"BioMed Central\",\"publisherLoc\":\"\",\"pmid\":19804604,\"pmc\":2735784,\"articleTitle\":\"Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\",\"volume\":6,\"issue\":2,\"fpage\":88,\"lpage\":98,\"body\":\"Familial breast cancer was first recognized in the Roman medical literature of 100 AD [1]. The first documentation of familial clustering of breast cancer in modern times was published by Broca, who reported 10 cases of breast cancer in 4 generations of his wife's family [2]. In the middle of the nineteen nineties it was proven at the molecular level that a substantial number of breast and ovarian cancers has hereditary monogenic aetiology [3,4]. Evaluation of frequency of pedigree-clinical signs characteristic for strong aggregations of breast/ovarian cancers among consecutive cases of cancers of these organs as well as analyses of cancer incidence in monozygotic twins indicate that about 30% of breast and ovarian cancers develop because of a strong genetic predisposition [5]. In other breast/ovarian cancers the significance of genetic factors was underestimated. However, recently it has been possible to show the characteristic constitutional background influencing development of cancer also in patients with sporadic neoplasms. Therefore now scientists think that in almost all patients with cancer a certain genetic background should be detectable, although influencing cancer risk to a various degree. Genetic abnormalities strongly related to cancer are called high risk

Most frequently strong genetic predisposition to breast/ovarian cancers are related to mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and most often it appears as syndromes of hereditary breast cancer -site-specific (HBC-ss), hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) and hereditary ovarian cancer (HOC).In family members of families with HBC-ss syndrome only breast cancers but not ovarian cancers are observed. In HBOC syndrome families both breast and ovarian cancers are diagnosed, and in HOC syndrome only ovarian but not breast cancers are detected. Operational clinical-pedigree criteria which we use in order to diagnose \\\"definitively\\\" or \\\"with high probability\\\" the discussed syndromes are summarized in Table 1. In the vast majority of cancer cases related to moderate risk genes family history is negative. HBC-ss, HBOC and HOC syndromes are clinically and molecularly heterogeneous. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most frequent cause of these syndromes.Table 1Pedigree-clinical diagnostic criteria of HBC-ss, HBOC and HOC syndromes [6]Number of breast or ovarian cancer cases in family:A - 3 (definitive diagnosis)\xE2\x80\x831) At least 3 relatives affected with breast or ovarian cancer diagnosed at any ageB - 2 (highly probable diagnosis)\xE2\x80\x831) 2 breast or ovarian cancer cases among first degree relatives (or second degree through male line)\xE2\x80\x832) 1 breast cancer and 1 ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age among first degree relatives (or second degree through male line)C - 1 (highly probable diagnosis)\xE2\x80\x831) Breast cancer diagnosed below 40 years of age\xE2\x80\x832) Bilateral breast cancer\xE2\x80\x833) Medullary or atypical medullary breast cancer\xE2\x80\x834) Breast and ovarian cancer in the same person\xE2\x80\x835) Breast cancer in maleBRCA1 syndromeIn this syndrome women carry a germline mutation in the BRCA1 gene. Carriers of a BRCA1 mutation have approximately 50-80% lifetime risk of breast cancer and 40% risk of ovarian cancer [7]. We estimate that these risks are 66% for breast cancer and 44% for ovarian cancer in the Polish population (Table 2). Both risks appear to be dependent on the type and localization of the mutation [8-10]. Our findings suggest that the risk of breast cancer in women with 5382insC is two times higher than in women with 4153delA.Table 2Risk of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers in Poland [8]A. Cumulated risk of breast cancerAge<304050607075Cumulated risk (%)1.66.53040.550.566B. Cumulated risk of ovarian cancerAge<304050607075Cumulated risk (%)13.512304144Incomplete penetrance of BRCA1 suggests that other factors, genetic and non-genetic modifiers, are important in carcinogenesis in the mutation carriers. The risk of ovarian cancer is modified by VNTR locus for HRAS 1 and is increased 2-fold in BRCA1 carriers harbouring one or two rare alleles of HRAS 1 [11]. We reported that the 135G>C variant in the RAD51 gene is strongly protective (OR = 0.5) against both ovarian and breast cancer [12,13].Carriers of a BRCA1 mutation are also at about 10% lifetime risk of fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers [14]. These data about the frequency of ovarian cancer in BRCA1 carriers appear to reflect the combined frequency of ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers, because these tumours were diagnosed as ovarian cancers in the past, and because they share similar morphology and cause elevated levels of the marker CA 125.The risk of cancer at other sites may be increased in carriers of a BRCA1 mutation as well, but the evidence is controversial and needs further studies.Breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1 carriers have particular clinical characteristics. The mean age at onset of breast cancer is about 42-45 years [15,16] and of ovarian cancer is about 54 years [17,18]. 18-32% of breast cancers are bilateral [19,20]. These are rapidly growing tumours: >90% of cases have G3 grade at the time of diagnosis and almost all ovarian cancers in women with a BRCA1 mutation are diagnosed in FIGO stage III\xC2\xB0/IV\xC2\xB0. Medullary, atypical medullary, ducal and oestrogen receptor negative (ER) breast tumours are common in BRCA1 carriers. BRCA1 mutation-positive tumours constitute about 10-15% of all ER-breast cancers [21-23]. Most carriers of a BRCA1 mutation report a positive family history of breast or ovarian cancer (Figure 1). However, 45% of BRCA1 carriers report a negative family history, mainly because of paternal inheritance and incomplete penetrance (Figure 3) [20].Figure 1Family with HOC syndrome and diagnosed constitutional 4153delA BRCA1 gene mutation.Figure 3Patient with ovarian cancer and detected 5382insC BRCA1 mutation from family with negative family history.Molecular diagnosis of constitutional BRCA1 mutationsThis topic has been described in detail in the section \\\"BRCA1 Test\\\".BRCA2 syndromePatients with this syndrome have a constitutional mutation in the BRCA2 gene [24]. According to literature data lifetime risk for BRCA2 carriers from families with definitive HBC-ss and HBOC is estimated at 31-56% for breast cancer and 11-27% for ovarian cancer [10,25-28]. Studies performed in 200 Polish families with strong aggregation of breast and/or ovarian cancers proved that mutations in the BRCA2 gene are rare, with a frequency of 4%. There are no studies on cumulated cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers from the Polish population. Most BRCA2 mutations from the Polish population probably slightly increase breast cancer risk. Studies performed in our centre showed that in families with aggregation of breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 50 and stomach cancer diagnosed in males before the age of 55, frequency of BRCA2 carriers is about 10-20% [29]. BRCA2 mutations are also related to a significantly increased although not precisely estimated risk of ovarian cancer and cancers of the digestive tract such as stomach, colon and pancreas in both females and males. Studies performed in our centre showed that BRCA2 mutations are detected with a frequency of 30% in families without breast cancer but with aggregation of ovarian cancer with stomach, colon or pancreatic cancer between first and second degree relatives [30]. BRCA2 studies performed on male breast cancer patients from the Pozna\xC5\x84 population showed that 15% of patients from this group are mutation carriers [31].Breast and ovarian cancers in families with BRCA2 mutations have characteristic features. Medium age of breast cancer is 52 and 53 in females and males, respectively, and 62 for ovarian cancer [31,32].Molecular diagnosis of BRCA2 mutationsUnlike for the BRCA1 gene, a founder effect for BRCA2 mutations was not observed with significant frequency in the Polish population [22]. It should be noted that \\\"de novo\\\" mutations are rare in these groups of genes; thus the presence of founder mutations in BRCA2 is probable. As yet BRCA2 mutations should be diagnosed individually for each family by full sequencing. Since the BRCA2 gene is large - about 70 genomic kbp - the cost of sequencing of this gene is high (around 1500 euro).In families with a detected marker of constitutional mutation the cost of analysis of two independently taken blood samples allowing exclusion or confirmation of carrier status among relatives is low - around 100 euro.BRCAX syndromeIn Poland in about 30% of families with definitively diagnosed HBC-ss and HBOC syndromes and in about 40% of families with HOC syndrome, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are not detected. In rare cases it is possible to diagnose one of the rare syndromes listed in Table 3. In these syndromes breast/ovarian cancers are observed with higher frequency. Many groups worldwide are trying to identify new genes causing BRCAX syndrome.Table 3Selected rare syndromes with increased risk of breast and/or ovarian cancerDiseaseClinical featuresGene mutation/InheritanceReferencesLi-Fraumeni syndromebreast cancers, sarcomas, brain tumours, leukaemia, renal gland cancerp53, high penetrance, AD17, 33Cowden diseasemultifocal mucoid skin abnormalities, benign proliferative abnormalities of different organs, thyroid cancers, breast/ovarian cancersPTEN, AD34, 35HNPCCcolon cancers, endometrial cancers, other organ cancers including breast and ovaryMSH2, MLH1, AD36Peutz-Jeghers syndromehyperpigmentation of the mouth, bowel polyps, colorectal cancers, small bowel cancers, gonadal tumours, breast cancersSTK11, AD37Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith (Z.

2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: rophylacticsOral contraceptivesContraindications for use of oral contraceptives (OC) by BRCA1 carriers aged below 25 are well documented. It was shown that OC used for 5 years by young women increase breast cancer risk by about 35% [43]. Since in about 50% of BRCA1 carriers family history is negative it seems to be necessary to perform the BRCA1 test in every young woman who wishes to use OC. OC used by BRCA1 carriers after the age of 30 seems not to influence breast cancer risk [43-45] but shows a 50% reduction of ovarian cancer risk [34], so use of OC after the age of 30 appears to be justified. As yet, there are no verified data concerning the effects of OC in families not related to BRCA1 mutation. However, there are studies indicating several-fold increased breast cancer risk in OC users from families with breast cancer aggregation [46]; thus it seams reasonable to avoid OC in families with HBC-ss and/or HBOC.Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)Prophylactic oopherectomy at the age of 35-40 is the gold standard for BRCA1/2 carriers and corresponds with risk reduction for both breast and ovarian cancer. It was shown that carriers after oopherectomy, who use oestrogen HRT, show a similar protective effect as patients who do not use HRT [47,48]. The influence of HRT in carriers without prophylactic oopherectomy is not well documented. Three-fold increased risk of breast cancer in HRT users with positive breast cancer family history was reported [49]. Therefore, the decision about HRT use should be made with particular caution.Breast feedingLong-term breast feeding is indicated in all females from families with HBC-ss, HBOC and HOC. It was shown in BRCA1 carriers that breast feeding over 18 months, counting together all pregnancies, reduces breast cancer risk - from 50-80% to 25-40% [50,51].Early deliveryWomen from the general population who delivered the first child before the age of 20 are at 50% lower breast cancer risk than nulliparous women. This observation was not confirmed in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation [52]. However, taking into consideration the fact that mutation carriers should elect prophylactic oopherectomy at age 35-40, they should not delay maternity significantly.ChemopreventionTamoxifenLiterature data clearly indicate that tamoxifen reduces by about 50% the risk of ER+ breast cancers. This effect was observed in healthy women as well as in women treated for breast cancer, where tamoxifen reduced the risk of contralateral breast cancer. A protective effect of tamoxifen was also observed in BRCA1 carriers in spite of the fact that most cancers in these patients are ER-. Such an effect of tamoxifen was observed in pre- and postmenopausal women [53,54]. According to present data it is justified to propose 5 year chemoprevention with tamoxifen to patients from families with HBC-ss, HBOC and BRCA1 mutation carriers as well after exclusion of all contraindications, especially related to clotting problems and endometrial hypertrophy.SeleniumStudies performed in our centre showed increased mutagen sensitivity in BRCA1 carriers as measured with the bleomycin test. This sensitivity may be normalized with some selenium supplements [55]. Chemoprevention with selenium has been observed to reduce cancer risk in both humans and animals. This question should be answered in BRCA1 carriers.AdnexectomyBoth retrospective and prospective observations of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations indicate that prophylactic adnexectomy decreases the risk of ovarian/peritoneal cancer to about 5% and breast cancer to 30-40%. Application of adnexectomy together with tamoxifen reduces breast cancer risk to about 10% in BRCA1 carriers [14]. Therefore, in our centre adnexectomy is recommended to all BRCA1/2 carriers aged over 35. This surgery is proposed to women from families with HBC-ss, HBOC and HOC but without detected BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation only if other pathologies of the female genital tract were recorded during control examinations. About 85% of our patients accept this type of prophylaxis [56].MastectomyThe main target of prophylactic mastectomy is reduction of breast cancer risk by removal of tissue at risk. Single cases of breast cancer can develop from the chest wall or from the axillary cave after prophylactic mastectomy. It was noted, however, that only 1% of patients from this group develop breast cancer after prophylactic surgery [57]. It seams reasonable to offer this type of surgery to highly motivated patients with definitively diagnosed high cancer risk, especially where tumoural and mammographically dense breast glands are observed which make early diagnosis extremely difficult. At present, mastectomies with immediate reconstruction are performed most frequently. This procedure ensures a good cosmetic effect [58].SurveillanceSurveillance in patients with HBC-ss, HBOC, HOC, as well as in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers is shown in Table 4. This scheme is individualized for particular patients with respect to age when particular examinations should begin. In some families where breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 25 or ovarian cancer before the age of 35 surveillance should begin 5 years earlier than the age of diagnosis of cancer in this family. In some cases, in addition to breast and ovary investigations patients receive colonoscopy, gastroscopy or evaluation of PSA level and prostate ultrasound if in family members symptoms from the colon, gastric or urinal tract are observed. However, it should be noted that some control examinations have limited value in detection of early cancers in BRCA1 carriers. Ovarian cancer in clinical stage I is detected in only 10% of women with a BRCA1 mutation. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis of early breast cancers is introducing significant progress [28,59]. This examination allows detection of 77% of breast cancers with diameter smaller than 1 cm and in combination with ultrasound its sensitivity in detection of early breast cancers rises to over 90% in BRCA1 carriers [59].Table 4Scheme of control examinations in families with high breast/ovarian cancer syndromesOrganExaminationAge of beginning(years)FrequencyBreastself examination20every monthmedical palpation20-25every 6 monthsUSG25every 6 months (6 months after mammography)MRI25every 12 monthsmammography35every 12 monthsFemale genital tracttransvaginal ultrasound30-35every 12 monthsCA 12530-35every 12 months (6 months after USG)TreatmentExisting data indicate that different rules should be applied or at least considered as an option in treatment of BRCA1 carriers. They include:\xE2\x80\xA2 radical mastectomy instead of lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy, because the risk of local recurrence in the above procedures is 1% and 8%, respectively (Narod SA, data not published);\xE2\x80\xA2 tamoxifen use in spite of ER- breast cancer, because of 50% risk reduction of contralateral breast cancer [53,60];\xE2\x80\xA2 adnexectomy not only because of prophylaxis but also because it was noted that 10-year survival is twice as high in patients after this type of treatment (Narod SA, data not published);\xE2\x80\xA2 breast cancer chemotherapy based on schemes without taxanes [61]; treatment results based on schemes with cis-platinum are very promising.Syndromes associated with genetic changes of moderately increased riskThe essential problem of clinical genetics is increased hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer in families with negative history of these cancers. Because of the small number of family members in present families, inheritance by the male line and not full penetrance, the influence of high risk genes like BRCA1/2 should be taken into consideration also in such families (about 50% of BRCA1 mutation carriers with breast cancer come from unaffected families [20]). However, a clear majority of cancers in such families are associated with other factors. The influence of multiple environmental factors on cancer risk has already been documented in the past. Recently, it has been shown that over 90% of patients with breast cancer carry constitutional genetic changes predisposing to development of this cancer [62]. In most cases, they are changes of moderately increased risk. In that context we can suppose that unfavourable environmental factors could lead to cancer development only in patients with a particular genetic background. To date the significance of several genetic changes has been documented in the Polish population, which is the cause for different options of clinical management for these patients. It was found that constitutional changes in the genes CHEK2 (1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, del5395, I157T), NBS1 (657del5), NOD2 (3020insC), CDKN2A (A148T), BRCA2 (5972C/T polymorphism) and CYP1B1 (homozygous GTC) are associated with increased breast cancer risk in the Polish population [63,64]. Carrier status of protein truncated mutation in the CHEK2 gene (1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, del5395) is associated with about 2.2-fold increased breast cancer risk. This risk concerns both young and older patients [63,64]. Therefore, the control breast examination in this group of patients starts from 25 years of age according to the scheme shown in Table 5. Carriers of mutation CHEK2 I157T have increased cancer risk to a smaller degree (1.4-fold higher than that in the general population).Table 5Options of control examinations for carriers of moderate cancer risk gene mutationsOrganExaminationAge of beginning(years)FrequencyCHEK2 (1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, del5395), NBS1 (657del5), NOD2 (3020insC), CDKN2A (A148T)self examination20every monthmedical palpation20-25every 6 monthsUSG25every 12 months(6 months after mammography)BRCA2 (5972C/T), CYP1B1 (homozygote GTC)mammography35every 12 monthsCHEK2 (I157T)self examination20every monthmedical palpation40every 6 monthsUSG40every 12 months(6 months after mammography)MRI40every 12 monthsmammography40every 12 monthsOccurrence of breast cancer at young age is not 
2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]: characteristic for this kind of mutation. However, patients with this mutation demonstrate lobular type of breast cancer much more often [65]. This cancer is difficult to diagnose using mammography; therefore in this group of patients magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended from 40 years of age. Mutation 657del5 in the NBS1 gene is associated with about 3.5-fold increased risk of breast cancer and this increase is the strongest for patients below 40 years old [66] and with positive cancer family history [67]. Mutation 3020insC in the NOD2 gene is associated with breast cancer at young age (OR = 1.9). Characteristic for this mutation is ductal breast cancer with a DCIS component [68]. This kind of cancer is more often accompanied by multiple calcifications; therefore mammography can be useful in prophylaxis of patients with mutations in the NOD2 gene. Polymorphism 5972C/T in the BRCA2 gene is also associated with increased risk of breast cancer before 40 years of age (OR = 1.4). The risk of cancer development is higher in homozygotes (OR = 4.8). This effect is observed at both young and older age [69]. Increased risk is also observed in carriers of CDKN2A A148T (OR = 1.5) and CYP1B1 (homozygote GTC) (OR = 1.5). In these cases an increased cancer risk at young age is observed. Medical care for patients with genetic changes NBS1 (657del5), NOD2 (3020insC), BRCA2 (5972C/T), CDKN2A (A148T), and CYP1B1 (homozygote GTC) begins at 25 years. Studies on the group of patients with a family history of ovarian cancer allowed characteristic clinical features of ovarian cancers without constitutional mutations in genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 to be distinguished. Cancers in this group, unlike cases arising on the basis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation, are more often diagnosed in postmenopausal (51-60 years) women and also show lower morphological grading and clinical staging. Analysis of the kind and location of cancers among relatives of examined women showed the increased frequency of ovarian cystadenoma (cystadenoma ovarii) [70]. Cystadenomas of the ovary are benign tumours which are able to, in some cases, undergo malignant transformation into borderline malignancy tumours, and sometimes even into cancer (cystadenocarcinoma) [71,72]. For development of this kind of tumours the following constitutional changes can predispose: NOD2 3020insC, CHEK2 I157T, CYP1B1 355T/T and DHCR7 W151X. In the group of \\\"increased risk\\\" there are mainly women at reproductive age (\xE2\x89\xA550 years), who being carriers of at least one of the above-mentioned molecular changes have over twofold increased risk of the development of ovarian borderline malignancy tumours (OR 2.26, P = 0.0005). Therefore for these women it should be considered to extend the screening options with an additional control examination of transvaginal USG (once a year) from 20-25 years. Early tumour detection and its surgical resection can prevent the development of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in the case of the 355T/T variant CYP1B1 gene carriers the screening options are extended with an additional control examination for MRI of the breast (once a year) for women aged 30-35 years, on account of almost 3-fold increased risk of the development of cancer of this organ (OR 2.75, P = 0.03) [73,74]. The preventive screening is also recommended to first and second degree female relatives of patients with ovarian cystadenoma including:\xE2\x80\xA2 control examination by using transvaginal USG (once a year), if in the patient ovarian borderline malignancy tumour and CHEK2 I157T were detected;\xE2\x80\xA2 control breast examination using MRI (once a year) in the case of female relatives of patients with the 355T/T variant of the CYP1B1 gene and with benign ovarian tumour.Studies on genetic predisposition to breast cancer or ovarian cystadenoma indicate the existence of multigenetic relations causing high risk of cancer development. It will probably require many years of analysis to discover them.SummaryAround 14 000 women develop breast or ovarian cancer in Poland every year. Advances in clinical genetics of cancers allow a significant number of these cancers to be prevented. Additionally, patients of known genetic background may be more effectively diagnosed and treated due to the application of special, nonstandard systems of control examinations and treatment.Figure 2Family with fulfilled clinical-pedigree criteria \\\"suspected HBC-ss\\\".

Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, and, to a lesser extent, CHEK2, TP53 and ATM, account for \xE2\x88\xBC25% of familial breast tumours (2). The remaining 75% of familial breast cancers (BRCAx tumours) and the majority of sporadic tumours are not attributable to known mutations in any of these genes. In bilateral cases of breast cancer (a second primary tumour in the contra-lateral breast), it is believed that the underlying \xE2\x80\x98mutation\xE2\x80\x99 is not limited to the epithelial cells of one breast, but rather is systemic (3). The importance of epigenetic changes in cancer development is now well established; however, the role of epigenetic changes as a mechanism for increased cancer risk is yet to be fully explored. Therefore, we hypothesized that some of the systemic epigenetic changes are either inherited or acquired in the early developmental stages and therefore should be detectable in the tissues other than breast, such as peripheral blood DNA (4,5). Since carcinogenesis induces numerous genetic and epigenetic changes, the study of tumour cells alone cannot distinguish whether epigenetic inactivation of tumour suppressor genes is a cause or a consequence of the neoplastic process in breast cancer (6). Identification of epimutations in the tissues and cells that are not affected by the disease process would favour causal association. Therefore, we aimed to identify epigenetic misregulation of candidate genes in the normal peripheral blood cells of cancer patients compared with controls.Epigenetics is the investigation of \xE2\x80\x98any information that is carried by the genome that is not coded by DNA\xE2\x80\x99 and includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin structure and non-coding RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression and various other genomic functions (7). DNA methylation studies in cancer revealed two main types of changes: hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands and hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences (8). DNA methylation is heritable through mitosis and is copied to the new strand by DNA methylatransferase 1 during DNA replication. Meiotic heritability of DNA methylation states, particularly transposon-associated methylation, has been shown in mice and in plants; however, it is not yet clear whether DNA methylation is heritable through meiosis in humans (9,10). Recent evidence suggests that epimutations are likely to arise somatically (11). Apart from trans-generational inheritance of epigenetic states, single-generation germline epigenetic effects are also possible. During germ cell development, the epigenome is reprogrammed with two waves of demethylation and re-establishment of DNA methylation marks allowing the possibility of errors that could persist in the germline (12). We have previously shown that the male germline exhibits locus-, cell- and age-dependent DNA methylation differences and that DNA methylation variation is significant across unrelated individuals, at a level that, by far, exceeds DNA sequence variation (13). This has allowed us to hypothesize that epigenetic variation in normal somatic cells, which need not be transgenerational, could be a predisposing factor for cancer.DNA methylation alterations have been studied extensively in breast tumour tissues most recently with genome wide analyses revealing hypermethylated as well as hypomethylated loci compared with matched adjacent tissues (14). Approximately 100 candidate genes have been reported throughout the literature as promoters hypermethylated at varying frequencies in breast cancers (Pubmeth http://matrix.ugent.be/pubmeth/search.html). For our study, we have selected genes that have either previously been identified as breast cancer susceptibility genes with known mutations in familial cases (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, TP53) or genes that are frequently hypermethylated in sporadic breast cancers (ESR1, SFN, CDKN2A, GSTP1, CDH1, CDH13, HIC1, PGR, SFRP1, MLH1, RARB and HSD17B4). We have used a two-stage design to firstly identify methylation variable positions (MVPs) in peripheral blood DNA and then secondly to test selected sites for an association with breast cancer in a larger sample set.RESULTSMicroarray analysisWe performed differential DNA methylation analysis using a methylation-sensitive enzyme-based approach to compare the methylation status of peripheral blood DNA of 14 bilateral breast cancer cases with 14 matched controls. We have designed a custom-tiled microarray covering a total of 4 Mb to completely cover 17 breast cancer susceptibility genes (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A) and an additional 34 genes also captured in the
2016-05-22T09:35:25.267111+00:00 app[web.1]:  flanking regions (Supplementary Material, Table S1). Using the Model-based Analysis of 2-Color Arrays (MA2C) algorithm, we were able to detect 181 significantly variable regions (P < 0.001) across the 28 individuals, which we have termed inter-individual MVPs. These included 143 intragenic, or gene-body, MVPs and 38 intergenic regions not associated with known gene promoters (Supplementary Material, Table S2). We observed intragenic methylation variability in each of the remaining targeted genes ATM, PGR, CDH1, CDH13, CHEK2, MLH1, RARB, HSD17B4, ESR1, SFRP1 and CDKN2A. Of all of the genes tested, we detected no significant intragenic methylation variability in six of the targeted genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, SFN, HIC1 and GSTP1 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2).Methylation variability is located in intragenic repetitive elementsAlthough the repetitive sequences themselves are not tiled, the enrichment of unmethylated genome can assess methylation status of the repetitive sequences by probing the unique sequences flanking the repeats (gaps in the tiling microarrays) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1B). To confirm the association of MVPs with repetitive elements, we have calculated the distance from the middle of each peak to the nearest repetitive element for each of the 181 identified loci. This analysis identified 80/181 (44%) of MVPs within 100 bp of the nearest repetitive element and 60% within 200 bp. This distribution is significantly closer to repetitive elements than can be expected by random chance (P = 7.39e\xE2\x80\x9307, Kolmogorov\xE2\x80\x93Smirnov test) (Fig.\xC2\xA01A). The distribution of repeat element type is not significantly different to the distribution throughout the genome. By aligning each gene at the transcription start sites (TSSs) and averaging the MATScores, we were able to generate a general picture of methylation variability over the first 10 kb of genes longer than 10 kb or across the first 5 kb of shorter genes. This reveals very low methylation variability over all gene promoters up to the TSS and a sharp increase in variability over the first 1 kb of intragenic sequence followed by periodic increase and decrease in variability every 2 kb (Fig.\xC2\xA01B).Figure\xC2\xA01.Methylation microarray analysis of 17 genes reveals methylation variability in repetitive elements. (A) The distance from each of the MVP to the nearest repetitive element was calculated for each of the 181 distinct MVPs revealing 44% of peaks within 100 bp of the nearest repetitive element. Random placement of 181 simulated MVP peaks reveals a distribution containing only 26% of peaks within 100 bp of the nearest repetitive element. Kolmogorov\xE2\x80\x93Smirnov test was used to determine the significance of the difference in distribution. (B) The smoothed average of MATScores (\xC2\xB12 SD in red) for genes aligned at the TSS reveals periodic increase in methylation variability across the first 10 kb (of genes >10 kb) or across the first 5 kb (of shorter genes, median 4.5 kb).Investigation of DNA methylation of ATMWe have performed a detailed validation of the MVPs within the targeted region surrounding one gene, ATM, which we have selected because it is known to contain germline mutations in familial breast cancer cases with a clear pathogenic role and it contains several intragenic MVPs associated with repetitive elements (Fig.\xC2\xA02A). We used bisulphite modification coupled with pyrosequencing assays to map methylated cytosines in the repetitive elements nearest to six MVPs in the targeted region surrounding ATM. We first analysed the 14 matched case\xE2\x80\x93control paired samples that we performed the microarray analysis on. Pair-wise comparison of methylation percentages confirmed the significant inter-individual variability in each of the loci identified by the microarray as exemplified by ATMmvp2a with 8/14 pairs significantly different (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank sum test) (Fig.\xC2\xA02B). Combined data from all of the 14 cases and controls revealed no statistically significant differences overall between patients and controls; however, the highest range of methylation across individuals were observed in the intragenic regions nearest the TSSs. The two most variable loci, ATMmvp1 and ATMmvp2, are both 4 kb downstream of the start sites of the genes NPAT and ATM, respectively (Fig.\xC2\xA02C). We detected no significant difference in genome-wide methylation as assessed by the pyrosequencing assay for LINE1; therefore, any differences detected are unlikely to be due to overall genome-wide methylation differences. Furthermore, in each of the 14 cases and controls, we detected no methylation of the ATM promoter CpG island in the peripheral blood DNA.Figure\xC2\xA02.Investigation of ATM gene methylation. (A) Methylation microarray data for the ATM gene locus. Seven methylation variable peaks were detected across the tiled region surrounding the ATM gene. Data are presented as a custom WIG file track on the UCSC genome browser. (B) Pair-wise comparison of ATM mvp2a methylation reveals increased methylation in 5/14 bilateral breast cancer patients (blue) compared with matched controls (yellow). Methylation of six CpG dinucleotides within the repetitive element mvp2a was determined by pyrosequencing. Pair-wise Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was used to determine statistical significance (# indicates P < 0.05). (C) DNA methylation analysis of MVPs reveals significant variability detected within the ATM gene. LINE 1 assay shows no significant differences in methylation of LINE1 repetitive elements in peripheral blood DNA of cases (blue) compared with controls (yellow). Methylation variability was detected in mvp1b, mvp2a, mvp2b, mvp3 and mvp4. Box and whisker plots represent median (centre line), inter-quartile range (box) and 95th percentiles (whisker), and samples outwith this range are represented as points.We performed a second stage of validation for the most variable loci, MVP2, within the ATM gene as well as the ATM CpG island and LINE1 assays in peripheral blood DNA from 190 bilateral breast cancer patients compared with 190 controls (Fig.\xC2\xA03). Again, we detected no significant difference between cases and controls in the LINE1 assay or the ATM CpG island. The LINE1 assay did, however, show inter-individual variability with genome-wide methylation values ranging from the lowest individual at 48% to the highest at 74% (median 56%). We did detect a significant increase in methylation of ATMmvp2b in the bilateral breast cancer patients (range 72.8\xE2\x80\x9398.4%, mean 91.4%) compared with control individuals (range 53\xE2\x80\x9398%, mean 89.8%) (P = 0.001686, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3). We have used an inter-quartile analysis of the ATM mvp2b methylation data to reveal a significant increase in methylation in cases in the highest quartile (P = 0.0011 using \xCF\x872 test), which is associated with a 3-fold increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio\xE2\x80\x94OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.78\xE2\x80\x935.86, P = 0.000083), compared with the lowest quartile (Table\xC2\xA01). We have analysed these data to identify whether the methylation status of this locus is associated with any phenotypic characteristics. We have investigated the age at blood draw (median 6.6 years after second diagnosis), age at first and second diagnoses and the time between diagnoses (Table\xC2\xA02). There was no association between the methylation level and tumour morphology, age at first full-term pregnancy, age at menarche, menopausal status, body mass index, weight, parity and the number of affected first-degree relatives (data not shown). Only the age and the age of diagnoses in the breast cancer patients were significantly associated with the methylation status (adjusted for multiple testing, P = 0.01035). Interestingly, even though the controls were age-matched with patients, age was not correlated with the methylation status in the controls (r = \xE2\x88\x920.1077, P = 0.07), only in the cases at blood draw (r = 0.242, P = 0.0004), at first diagnosis (r = 0.189, P = 0.0045) and at second diagnosis (r = 0.251, P = 0.0002) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4).Figure\xC2\xA03.Methylation of LINE1, ATM CpG island, mvp2a and mvp2b in 190 bilateral breast cancer cases compared with 190 controls.

(B) Pyrosequencing-based methylation analysis of 190 bilateral breast cancer cases compared with 190 matched controls reveals no methylation in the promoter CpG island and significant inter-individual methylation variability in the intronic mvp2a and mvp2b.

Therefore, the small effect (increase in methylation at ATM mvp2b) in patients compared with controls could be due to a larger effect in a small subpopulation of cells within the heterogeneous peripheral blood cell population. We have addressed this question by isolation of B cells, T cells and monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two healthy controls and investigating the methylation status of this locus. We show that the methylation of ATMmvp2b does not show cell-specific methylation differences between these three blood cell fractions, and all fractions have similar methylation levels to the whole PBMCs (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5).In order to investigate the relationship between methylation at ATM mvp2b and expression of ATM, we screened a large panel of cancer cell lines and observed a similar methylation range as seen in peripheral blood (77\xE2\x80\x9399%); however, the distribution of methylation percentages is significantly higher in the cancer cell lines than in the peripheral blood DNA of the patients and controls (P < 1e\xE2\x80\x9314, Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Fig.\xC2\xA04A). We performed quantitative RT\xE2\x80\x93PCR for ATM expression in five breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and BT549) and analysed pre-existing gene expression data for 18 mesenchymal tumour cell lines (16) (Fig.\xC2\xA04B and C). In both cases, we observed a correlation between the methylation of the intragenic repetitive element and expression of ATM (Spearmans rho \xE2\x88\x920.9 and \xE2\x88\x920.33, respectively).Figure\xC2\xA04.Correlation between methylation of ATM mvp2b and expression of ATM in cancer cell lines. (A) Methylation analysis in 62 cancer cell lines reveals a similar range of methylation as in PBMCs of breast cancer patients (77\xE2\x80\x9399%); however, the distribution is skewed towards increased methylation in the cancer cell lines (green). Methylation distributions of breast cancer patients (red) and controls (black) are shown for comparison. (B) ATM expression was determined by qRT\xE2\x80\x93PCR in the five breast cancer cell lines and by gene expression microarray data (C) for a panel of sarcoma cell lines.

Correlation between methylation and expression is shown using Spearmans rank correlation coefficient.DISCUSSIONThis project is the first comprehensive DNA methylation study using high-density tiling arrays to look for methylation variation in white blood cells of bilateral breast cancer patients compared with controls. It is well established that identification of high-risk patients guiding the use of preventative treatment such as intensive surveillance (e.g. mammography), chemoprevention (e.g. tamoxifen) or prophylactic surgery (e.g. radical mastectomy) can significantly reduce the burden of breast cancer (17). Therefore, all additional tools with which we can predict a patient\xE2\x80\x99s risk of cancer, such as DNA methylation markers, would improve our ability to identify those at high risk. The difficulty in finding genetic markers of common breast cancer risk has been recently exemplified by a number of extraordinarily large case\xE2\x80\x93control studies that have identified only minor increases in breast cancer risk (18,19). The overall goal of this current study was to screen candidate genes for epigenetic differences in peripheral blood DNA to identify markers of common breast cancer risk. We believe that DNA methylation markers could be more informative, as they are more stable than other candidate biomarkers such as RNA or protein-based markers, and can act as a surrogate for environmental exposures (20). The extent to which epigenetic markers can be used for risk assessment is yet to be fully explored.\xE2\x80\x98Gene body methylation\xE2\x80\x99 is a recent term describing the DNA methylation that occurs throughout the gene from the TSS, through exons and introns, to the 3\xE2\x80\xB2 untranslated region (21\xE2\x80\x9323). In Arabidopsis, the level of gene-body methylation has been linked to the level of gene transcription such that gene-body methylation was absent in genes that were not transcribed, was low in genes that were transcribed at low levels, higher levels of methylation in the highest transcribed genes but even higher methylation levels in genes that had intermediate levels of transcription (22). Gene-body methylation is also more associated with genes on the active X chromosome rather than on the inactive X-chromosome (21). The association with the transcription of individual genes and gene-body methylation has not yet been investigated in cancer. We have recently suggested that gene-body methylation in the human genome may be associated with intragenic repetitive elements and that altered methylation in the gene-body may be a mechanism of modulating the level of transcription (24). In the present study, we show for the first time that the methylation of one intragenic repetitive element inversely correlates with the expression of the gene which supports this hypothesis. Although there are numerous examples in the literature showing that active genes have more gene-body methylation levels than inactive genes, all of these studies compare the gene body methylation levels of one gene with another and compare the expression levels (22). These studies make a distinction between \xE2\x80\x98On\xE2\x80\x99 expression and gene-body methylation compared with \xE2\x80\x98Off\xE2\x80\x99 expression and no gene-body methylation. We suggest from our data that the level of gene-body methylation may be modulating or fine-tuning the level of expression of the active genes. To date, there has been no report looking at the subtle differences in gene-body methylation across samples and associating that with the expression of the same gene in those samples. Therefore, our study is the first report of an association between different levels of gene-body methylation and expression of the same gene.How gene-body methylation may alter the gene expression, or alternatively how expression level may affect the methylation level, is still not clear. The mvp within ATM that we have identified could be a reporter of a more extended regulatory epigenetic profile at ATM, similar to a tag SNP for a region of linkage disequilibrium in DNA sequence variation. Alternatively, this region could be involved in the regulation of unannotated non-coding transcript(s) or antisense transcripts that regulate the sense gene (22). Recent reports have shown a high level of antisense transcription throughout the genome which could be involved in gene regulation, which suggests new levels of understanding of the process of transcriptional regulation (25,26).Our study of the breast cancer susceptibility genes has provided evidence that the regions of inter-individual methylation variability are located within repetitive elements, particularly SINEs (Alu sequences), and that the variability is highest at \xE2\x88\xBC1 kb downstream of the TSSs and increases periodically along the gene. We interpret this increased variability as the point in the genome where the methylation along the chromatin is changing from unmethylated at the promoters to fully methylated in the gene-body. We have identified one repetitive element, ATM mvp2b, which is significantly more methylated in the peripheral blood DNA of women affected with bilateral breast cancer compared with matched control individuals. On its own, this is not sufficient to be considered a potential diagnostic test, as there is considerable overlap between cases and controls and the receiver operating curve area under the curve of 0.59 supports this lack of specificity as a diagnostic. However, this may improve in combination with similar markers from the other genes that we have identified, if such markers provide an additive effect. Interestingly, not all genes showed signs of inter-individual methylation variability. For some of the genes, this could be explained by the short length (e.g. SFN, GSTP1 and HIC1); however, this is not the case for other longer genes which could represent genes with conserved methylation patterns (e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53) compared with other long genes that show high levels of methylation variability (e.g. CDH13).The ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) mutated (ATM) gene is considered a breast cancer susceptibility gene, as female heterozygotes from A-T families have an increased risk of breast cancer and a number of breast cancer families have been identified with germline ATM mutations (27,28). Although one small study by Vo et al. identified increased ATM promoter methylation associated with decreased expression in locally advanced sporadic breast cancers, numerous other reports suggest no evidence of promoter methylation of this gene in breast cancers (29\xE2\x80\x9332). One finding that is consistent is that ATM expression is often reduced in breast tumours (31\xE2\x80\x9334). This could be explained by genetic haploinsufficiency (35); however, our data in peripheral blood DNA and cancer cell lines suggest a novel mechanism of decreased expression mediated by aberrant gene-body methylation, which warrants further investigation in tumour ti

We propose that if normal tissues of the individual, including mammary epithelial cells, express lower levels of ATM owing to aberrantly increased gene-body methylation, then these individuals may be more susceptible to DNA mutations in those cells.The biggest risk factor for breast cancer and indeed most cancers is increasing age. The incidence of breast cancer in women doubles for every 10 years until menopause with a relative risk of >10-fold (36). An association between DNA methylation and increasing age has also been reported, for example increased DNA methylation variability in older twins compared with younger twins and increasing variability with increasing age in familial clusters (37,38). However, we have found that the association between the level of methylation at ATM mvp2b and increasing age is only associated in the bilateral breast cancer patients and not in controls. This suggests that the relationship between age and DNA methylation may be more dependent on the phenotype of the individuals, in this case cancer, and may be due to other predisposing environmental exposures that accumulate with age.One of the confounding factors which we cannot rule out in this study is the long-term effects of previous therapy in the patients that are not present in the controls. Future studies will need to investigate peripheral blood samples taken before the initiation of treatment preferably in prospectively collected cohort studies to rule out this possibility. However, if therapy accounted for an overall difference in genome-wide DNA methylation, the LINE1 assay for genome-wide methylation and the other unique sites tested (ATM mvp2a) would have detected this, which it did not. Another confounding factor is the effect of tissue-specific methylation. Although we have shown that in two healthy controls there is no evidence for cell-type-specific methylation of this locus, we cannot rule out this possibility in cancer patients. Therefore, this needs to be addressed in cancer patients.In summary, we have shown that inter-individual variability in gene-body methylation is associated with repetitive elements and that it is possible to identify regions of significant differences between bilateral breast cancer patients and controls that may be useful as additional surrogate markers for breast cancer risk. This research also demonstrates the correlation between the level of gene-body methylation and mRNA level of a single gene and highlights the potential for gene-body epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Finally, this work also supports the need to interrogate whole epigenomes, including repetitive elements, using tiling arrays or unbiased next-generation sequencing approaches to investigate the full complement of methylation variability across the genome.MATERIALS AND METHODSClinical sampleFor the microarray analysis, peripheral blood DNA samples from 14 women with bilateral breast cancer were compared with the DNA samples from 14 age- and ethnicity-matched controls. The cases were selected by being (i) BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation negative, confirmed clinically; (ii) metachronous tumours (separate sites) (iii) and those meet the bilateral case criteria set by Chaudary et al. (39), namely (a) subsequent tumour contains in situ component; (b) distinct histological types; (c) subsequent tumour has greater degree of differentiation; (d) no evidence of metastatic spread from ipsilateral tumour. These samples were collected with ethics approval from the Institute for Womens Health, Toronto, Canada. Peripheral blood DNA samples from a second set of 190 bilateral cases and 190 controls were obtained from the British Breast Cancer study (40,41). Bilateral breast cancer patients were ascertained through the English and Scottish cancer registries, controls were friends or non-blood relatives of breast cancer patients. Controls were age-matched to patients at the age at blood draw (within \xC2\xB1 2 months) and all patients and controls were Caucasians resident in the UK. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the South East Multicentre Research Ethics Committee.DNA methylation profiling using microarraysA custom oligonucleotide tiling array was designed to target the testable genomic regions (plus 100 kb flanking sequence) of genes, including breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 (82 kb), BRCA2 (86 kb), CHEK2 (57 kb) and ATM (143 kb) along with other genes that are known to be commonly methylated in breast cancer, including ESR1 (296 kb), SFN (1.3 kb), CDKN2A (27 kb), TP53 (19 kb), GSTP1 (2.8 kb), CDH1 (96 kb), CDH13 (1169 kb), HIC1 (4.0 kb), PGR (92 kb), SFRP1 (47 kb), MLH1 (57 kb), RARB (97 kb), HSD17B4 (90 kb). Arrays were designed by and performed by Nimblegen Inc. Specified regions were from UCSC HG17 with overlapping 50mer probes every 21 bp excluding repeat masked regions, and the probe set was replicated four times on the chip and averaged data were used for analysis. In addition to the 17 targeted genes, we also captured 26 genes and 12 partial genes which were peripherally targeted in the flanking regions by these tiling arrays (Supplementary Material, Table S1).The general principle of these DNA methylation arrays consists of hybridization of the unmethylated fraction of genomic DNA to the microarray containing oligonucleotides that represent the genomic region of interest. We performed the enrichment as described previously (42). Briefly, we used a cocktail of three methylation-sensitive enzymes (HpaII, AciI and Hin6I) to digest individuals genomic DNA and used ligation-mediated PCR to amplify products which were cleaned using Qiagen PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen, Canada), labelled with either Cy3 or Cy5 dyes and co-hybridized in matched pairs to the custom array. Hybridization intensity correlates with the DNA methylation status at the genomic locus homologous to each oligonucleotide on the array. MA2C was used for normalization, peak detection (using a cut-off of P < 0.001) and generation of MATScores for each probe (43).PyrosequencingDNA samples were bisulphite-converted using EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA) following the manufacturers protocol. Pyrosequencing of LINE1 elements was performed using the LINE1 assay (Biotage, Hertford, UK). All other pyrosequencing assays were designed using the PyroQ assay design software (primers in Supplementary Material, Table S3). All pyrosequencing assays for repetitive elements included at least one primer in a unique sequence outside of the repeat and followed by a unique nested primer pair for some amplicons to ensure specific amplification. A common tag was placed on either the forward or the reverse primer (depending on the strand to be sequenced), and a common universal biotinylated primer was used for all reactions as described previously (44). PCR was performed as described previously and cycling conditions included denaturation at 95\xC2\xB0C for 4 min, followed by 10 cycles of 94\xC2\xB0C for 15 s, touchdown from 60\xE2\x80\x9350\xC2\xB0C (\xE2\x88\x921 degree/cycle) for 15 s and 72\xC2\xB0C for 20 s, followed by a further 30 cycles at 50\xC2\xB0C annealing temperature. The second PCR used 2 \xC2\xB5l of a 1:10 dilution of the first PCR as template and the same cycling conditions (13). All products were confirmed to be single bands by agarose gel electrophoresis. Methylation values were calculated as an average of all CpG sites within each assay as determined by the Pyro Q-CpG Software (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden).Blood cell fractionationPeripheral blood was collected from two healthy female donors with informed consent. PBMCs were isolated using a standard Ficoll-paque protocol, and blood cell fractions were isolated using antibody-coated magnetic microbeads and MACS MS separation columns (cat: 130-042-201) following the manufacturers protocol (Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, UK). Briefly, 5\xE2\x80\x9310 million PBMCs were incubated with each of the antibody-coated beads for B-cells (CD19, cat: 130-050-301), T-cells (CD2, cat: 130-091-114) or monocytes (CD14, cat: 130-050-201). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole PBMCs and each cell-specific population. Bisulphite conversion and pyrosequencing were performed as described.Cancer cell linesDNA was extracted from 62 cell lines from brain (n = 7), breast (n = 5), colon (n = 5), leukaemia (n = 5), lymphoma (n = 9), sarcoma (n = 15) and others (n = 16). A full list of cell line names is included in Supplementary Material, Table S4. Bisulphite conversion and pyrosequencing were performed as described.Quantitative RT\xE2\x80\x93PCRQuantitative RT\xE2\x80\x93PCR was performed for ATM using an Eppendorf Mastercycler with the following primer pairs: ATM_F (5\xE2\x80\xB2-tgctcatacagcaggccata-3\xE2\x80\xB2) with ATM_R (5\xE2\x80\xB2-aaggctgaatgaaagggtaattc-3\xE2\x80\xB2) and GAPDH_F (5\xE2\x80\xB2-ggagtcaacggatttggtcgta-3\xE2\x80\xB2) with GAPDH_R (5\xE2\x80\xB2-ggcaacaatatccactttaccagagt-3\xE2\x80\xB2). The reaction mix contained 1\xC3\x97 SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and 0.5 \xC2\xB5m of each forward and reverse primers in a volume of 30 \xC2\xB5l. PCR cycling consisted of 95\xC2\xB0C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95\xC2\xB0C for 30 s, 60\xC2\xB0C for 60 s, followed by a meltcurve analysis. Fold-change in expression was calculated by \xCE\x94\xCE\x94Ct normalized to GAPDH for each sample and normalizing each of the cell lines to the cell line SKBR3.Statistical analysisThe majority of statistical analysis in this study was performed using various R packages as described earlier. The simulated peak distributions were determined by randomly placing single peaks across the same tiled region and calculating the distances to the real repetitive elements and repeating 10 000 times. Kolmogorov\xE2\x80\x93Smirnov test was used to test the significance of the difference in distributions (ks.test). We used Wilc

We performed further analysis for ATM mvp2a to confirm the significance of this difference using 1000 randomized simulations of the test statistic (W, from the Wilcoxon rank sum test) to calculate the real P-value of the observed test statistic. We used either generalized linear model (glm) regression or logistic regression analysis (lm) for further analysis of ATM MVP2b to assess the associations with phenotypic data. Inter-quartile analysis was performed by calculating the quartiles from all of the data (quantile) and counting the number of cases or controls in each quartile. We then used the \xCF\x872 test (chisq.test), odds ratio (oddsratio) and Cochran\xE2\x80\x93Armitage trend test (independence_test).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSupplementary Material is available at HMG online.FUNDINGThis work was funded in part by a pilot study grant from the Canadian Cancer Etiology Research Network (CCERN) to A.P., S.N. and J.M.F. and a grant from the University College London Hospital Charities to J.M.F.

Malignant progression of breast cancer involves the conversion of \xE2\x80\x9Cbenign proliferative lesions\xE2\x80\x9D and carcinomas in situ to early (stages I and II) disease, to locally advanced (stage III) disease, and then to metastasis to bone, brain, lungs, and other sites (stage IV).Fundamental to malignant progression are the heterotypic processes regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hypoxia, desmoplasia, and angiogenesis5,6 The development of cancer involves dysregulation of proliferative-signaling and growth-inhibitory factors, activation of oncogenes, and loss of tumor suppressor genes, all of which result in suppression of apoptosis and senescence.6 The increasing understanding of the pathophysiological background of breast cancer is associated with new molecular techniques, improved risk assessment, targeted therapy, and individualized treatment.1,3,7 Gene expression profiling may provide predictive and prognostic gene signatures which could help characterize tumors and enable more tailored therapies.8,9Interest in novel prognostic markers is based on the fact that a significant number of patients with early-stage breast cancer harbor microscopic metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Many molecular markers that have been studied have both prognostic and predictive values. Prognostic markers are indicators of aggressiveness, invasiveness, extent of spread of tumors, and thus, correlate with survival independent of systemic therapy and can be used to select patients at risk. On the other hand, predictive markers are reports which allow clinicians to expect therapeutic outcomes and decide future treatment plans. This review summarizes mainly the prognostic values of classical (Ki67, ER, PR, HER2) and novel molecular factors (p53, p14ARF, cyclin D1, cyclin E, TBX2/3, BRCA1/2, and VEGF) for breast cancer. These novel molecular markers have been chosen from the viewpoint of involvement in the regulation of the p53 and RB tumor suppressor pathways, DNA damage response, and angiogenesis/metastasis, which play critical roles in human breast cancer development.Ki67Proliferative markers have been broadly evaluated as prognostic factor for early stage breast cancer patients. Ki67, a nuclear non-histone protein, was identified by Gerdes et al as after immunization of mice with the Hodgkin\xE2\x80\x99s lymphoma.10\xE2\x80\x9313 Ki67 is expressed only in cells in the proliferative phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M phases). Ki67 is vital for cell proliferation, since downregulation of Ki67 using antisense nucleotides prevents cell proliferation.10 Ki67 is tightly controlled and regulated, implying a fundamental role in cell proliferation. However, it has been very difficult to determine its function because of its lack of obvious homology with known proteins. Bridger et al suggested a role of Ki67 in organizing DNA, based on its localization to extranucleolar sites during early G1; these sites contain centromeric and satellite DNA.14 Ki67 is also known to bind to DNA. Mac-Callum and Hall suggested a structural role for Ki67 within the nucleolus, based on its ability to interact with other proteins and bind with RNA and DNA.14,15 They also suggested that Ki67 is an essential factor in the synthesis of ribosomes during cell division.15 Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the roles of Ki67 in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.Ki67 expression is usually estimated as the percentage of tumor cells positively stained by the antibody, with nuclear staining being the most common criterion of proliferative index. Numerous studies have shown that Ki67 is of prognostic value in many types of malignant tumors. In breast cancer, most studies show a strong, statistically significant correlation with clinical outcomes, both on univariate and multivariate analyses. A strong correlation has been noted between the percentage of cells positive for Ki67 and the nuclear grade, age, and mitotic rate.16,17 Multiple studies have indicated that breast cancer overexpress Ki67 in more than 20\xE2\x80\x9350% of the cells are at high risk of developing recurrent disease, showing a statistically significant correlation with clinical outcome, such as disease-free survival or overall survival.18\xE2\x80\x9330The predictive value of Ki67 on the survival of breast cancer patients has also been studied. To determine the clinical significance of the level of tumor cell proliferation during endocrine therapy for breast cancer, Dowsett et al31 measured the expression of Ki67 in tumor biopsy samples taken before and after 2 weeks of pre-surgical treatment with anastrozole or tamoxifen alone, or the combination, in 158 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In a multivariable analysis, they found that higher Ki67 expression after 2 weeks of endocrine therapy was associated with lower recurrence-free survival (P = 0.004) whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not.31 To compare the prognostic significance of Ki67 expression in breast cancer before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the expression of Ki67 was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in pre-therapy core-needle biopsy and post-therapy surgical excision specimens.32 In a matched cohort of 103 patients, post-therapy Ki67 was the only significant independent prognostic factor among Ki67, ER, PR, HER2, clinical stage, histology on multivariate analysis of relapse-free survival. On multivariate analysis for overall survival, both pre- and excision Ki67 expression was significant independent predictors, but the latter showed a stronger prognostic impact. In a cohort of 284 patients with only excision samples, post-therapy Ki67 was a significant independent prognostic factor. They concluded that post-chemotherapy Ki67 is a strong predictor of outcome for patients not achieving a pathological complete response.32,33 In addition, Ki67 correlates with other well-characterized proliferation markers, such as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is a target of E2Fs34 (Fig. 1). Ki67 staining will continued to be used as a useful laboratory test to predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients since it is technically easier and more closely associated with clinical outcomes than DNA ploidy analysis or S phase measurement by flow cytometry.Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors (ER and PR)The ER and PR are dimeric, gene-regulatory proteins. Estrogen and progesterone are well-established endocrine steroid regulators that modulate multiple aspects of mammary gland pathology. These two hormones work together to direct mammary epithelial growth, differentiation, and survival.35 Although both steroids are commonly thought to be of primary importance for tumors arising in the reproductively competent years, between puberty and menopause, local aromatization of adrenal androgens provides additional estrogens in the postmenopausal years. Estrogen and progesterone act through their nuclear receptors to modulate transcription of target genes.35,36 Genes encoding the receptors for each class of steroids are members of a single large superfamily of transcription-modulating factors. ERs may exist either in homodimeric or heterodimeric species, composed of \xCE\xB1 and \xCE\xB2 receptors acting as hormone-dependent transcriptio

Although it is known that ER\xCE\xB1 is of key importance in the mammary ductal elongation of puberty, PR and ER\xCE\xB2 appear to be more involved with lactational differentiation of the lobules.38,39 From knockout studies in mice, it is apparent that PR plays important role in ductal and lobuloalveolar development of normal mammary gland.40Overexpression of ER\xCE\xB1 is a well-established prognostic factor in breast cancer patients. Generally, ER\xCE\xB1-positive breast cancers are associated with slow tumor growth, lower histology grade, DNA diploidy, and thus a better overall prognosis.35 More than 90% of lobular breast carcinomas are ER-positive; while medullary and inflammatory carcinomas are predominantly ER-negative. ER/PR-negative tumors are often associated with aggressive disease, and these tumors frequently show amplification of HER2, c-Myc, and Int2 oncogenes, and mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene.The value of ER\xCE\xB1 status as an independent prognostic variable has been diminished by its association with other established indicators of favorable prognosis. These include older age of the patient, low-grade histology, a favorable nuclear grade, a low S-phase fraction, a normal content of DNA, a low proliferative index, and a low thymidine labeling index.41 In addition, because adjuvant or palliative hormone therapy is a common treatment for patients with ER-positive tumors receives, it is difficult to evaluate the prognostic value of their ER status alone. In some studies, the longer duration of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival rates of patients with ER\xCE\xB1-positive tumors are seen only in the presence of hormone therapy. In addition, the favorable effect of ER\xCE\xB1-positive status as a discriminant often is lost after several years, suggesting that treatment benefit is temporary.42,43 When node-positive patients not receiving adjuvant hormone therapy were studied, the 5-year DFS rate was 20% higher for ERpositive patients compared with that for ER-negative patients. However, the 5-year DFS rate of the most favorable subgroup (i.e. patients with one to three positive nodes and ER-positive tumors) was below 60%.42 Among node-negative patients, small but statistically significant differences in DFS and overall survival rates have been found between ER-positive cases and ER-negative cases after various periods of follow-up. The results of a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in over 3,000 patients showed ER status to be more important for prognosis than tumor size in node-negative cases, but not in node-positive cases.43 In one study, the ER status was less important for predicting duration of DFS or overall survival than the nuclear grade and the number of positive nodes.44 Allred and colleagues showed that tamoxifen decreased the risk of local regional recurrence in patients with ER-positive ductal carcinoma in situ.45The prognostic significance of ER\xCE\xB2 is not well defined.46\xE2\x80\x9348 Honma et al49 studied archival materials from 442 invasive breast cancers treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy and with a long follow-up period (median: 11.1 years) using three antibodies to detect ER\xCE\xB2N, ER\xCE\xB21, and ER\xCE\xB2cx (ER\xCE\xB22). Positive staining for ER\xCE\xB2N or ER\xCE\xB21 was associated with significantly better survival. By contrast, ER\xCE\xB2cx status showed no association with length of survival. ER\xCE\xB21status was significantly associated with longer survival in postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, women. ER\xCE\xB21 positivity was associated with significantly better survival in patients with ER\xCE\xB1(\xE2\x80\x93)PR(\xE2\x80\x93) or ER\xCE\xB1(\xE2\x80\x93)PR(\xE2\x80\x93)HER2(\xE2\x80\x93) (triple-negative) tumors, which are widely believed to have a poor prognosis. Another study also showed that higher expression of ER\xCE\xB2 in ER\xCE\xB1/PR-positive breast cancer was associated with longer overall survival (70% for high ER\xCE\xB2 vs. 30% for low ER\xCE\xB2 at 100 months) compared with the same group of patients expressing much lower levels of ER\xCE\xB2. Differential expression of ER\xCE\xB2 had no prognostic value in patients with ER\xCE\xB1/PR negative breast cancer.50 Further studies will be required to establish the value of ER\xCE\xB2 to predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients.Because the growth of breast cancer is often regulated by the female sex steroids, determinations of the cellular concentrations of ER and PR in the tumor continue to be used as predictors of good prognosis and of potential benefit from anti-hormonal therapy. To improve the value of ER determinations for tumor prognosis, tests for the presence of the estrogen-regulated PR protein are routinely performed. In many breast tumor cell lines\xE2\x80\x94and in normal tissues containing ER, such as the endometrium and brain\xE2\x80\x94PR expression is induced by estrogen.51,52 It is still not known whether ER regulates PR in normal human mammary epithelium in precisely the same subpopulation of ductal and lobular luminal cells, although this assumption is considered to be likely. It is of interest that the ER and PR appear to be strongly up-regulated in ductal carcinoma in situ and in hormone-dependent breast cancer, relative to normal mammary epithelium.PR is a heterodimeric protein with A and B subunits. Overexpression of the PR indicates that the ER pathway is intact, even if the tumor is reported as ER-negative.51,52 When biochemical ligand-binding assays indicate concentrations of 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein or more, the tumors are generally considered ER-positive and PR-positive for clinical purposes. The ER and PR status can be measured using immunohistochemistry. These results correlate closely with biochemical ligand binding assays and clinical response rates to endocrine therapy.53,54 Furthermore, PR promoter methylation is commonly observed in primary breast cancer cases and may be a mechanism by which this protein is downregulated.55 Importantly, higher PR levels are negatively correlated with tumor size and grade. In a recent study, Liu et al showed that expression of PR in ER-positive tumors improved survival of patients receiving estrogen receptor therapy. Hence, PR may be used as prognostic factor in this group of patients.56 In summary, ER will be used as a marker to predict the response to hormonal therapy and PR will be used as a predictor of response to hormonal therapy as well as a prognostic factor in ER+ breast cancers.Estrogen and progesterone are well known as direct modulators of expression of growth factor receptor pathways and downstream, cell-cycle regulatory genes known as nuclear protooncogenes. The nuclear proto-oncoproteins and other cell-cycle regulatory proteins, such as AIB-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D1, represent points of regulatory convergence of steroid and growth factor pathways in cells. Of considerable interest is the observation that the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1 also interacts with the ER\xCE\xB1 to promote its transcriptional activity57,58 (Fig. 1). Parallel observations have also been made with the AIB-1 (amplified in breast cancer 1; SRC-3) protein, regarding both sensitization of ER transactivation and growth factor signal transduction.59 AIB1 is an ER coregulatory protein that together with other co-activators, like transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) and nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR), is implicated in the estrogen signaling pathway and estrogen- regulated tumor progression. An alternatively spliced variant form of AIB-1 is even more potent for these effects.59 It has been reported that ER\xCE\xB1 activation and nuclear localization, as well as coactivator interactions, are regulated through its phosphorylation.5,60Harigopal et al studied the prognostic significance of AIB1, TIF2 and NCoR protein expression in 670 breast cancer specimens by breast tissue microarray, and demonstrated the relationship of coregulatory proteins to ER, PR and HER2/neu.61 High AIB1 expression was associated with poor patient outcome (P = 0.002), while no association was noted for TIF2 (P = 0.376) or NCoR (P = 0.12). When subclassified by nodal or ER status, AIB1 was not prognostic in the node-positive and ER-positive subsets. However, in the ER-negative and node-negative subsets, high AIB1 expression was associated with poor patient outcome (P = 0.02 and P = 0.007 respectively).61 There was significant positive correlation between AIB1 and ER/PR status and with other cofactors (TIF2 and NCoR), but not with HER2/neu status. Thus, high AIB1 expression predicted worse overall survival in this study, suggesting that AIB1 may be involved in breast carcinogenesis.HER2HER2 (also known as c-erbB-2 or neu) is a protooncogene that encodes a 185-kDa tyrosine kinase glycoprotein belonging to the EGFR family.62\xE2\x80\x9365 The extracellular domain in HER2 is 44% homologous to the corresponding region in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the internal domain is 88% homologous to this region in EGFR.66 In addition to EGFR, the type I subfamily includes HER2, HER3, and HER4.62,63 These receptors all possess a large glycosylated extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is overexpressed in \xE2\x88\xBC30 % of breast cancer cases, primarily due to gene amplification. Within these cases, 60% are ductal carcinomas in situ and 20\xE2\x80\x9330% are infiltrating breast carcinomas.60,67,68 A representative picture of HER2 overexpression in human breast cancer is shown in Figure 2a.The HER2 status can be determined in human tumor samples using immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Amplification and/or overexpression of the HER2 oncogene are/is associated with a poor DFS rate in patients with ax

Patients with HER2 overexpression had a significantly worse overall survival (P = 0.0012) with twice the mortality rate of women without detectable HER2 expression.70 In multivariate analysis, detection of HER2 overexpression was the second most predictive independent variable for survival after nodal status. Overexpression of HER2 was more common among tumors of high nuclear grade (29%) than those of low nuclear grade (12%). The association of HER2 overexpression with decreased survival was evident only among women with tumors of low nuclear grade. In this subgroup, HER2 overexpression was associated with an approximately fivefold increase in mortality rate (P = 0.00001). Thus, the combined predictive value of HER2 overexpression and nuclear grade was evident regardless of lymph node status.71 Allred and colleagues71 evaluated HER2 expression using immunohistochemistry in 613 patients with node-negative breast cancer enrolled in the Intergroup Study 0011. In their study, patients were stratified into low-risk groups (n = 307) and high-risk groups (n = 306). Lowrisk patients were defined as having small (<3 cm), ER-positive tumors and were observed without additional treatment after initial surgery. High-risk patients had either ER-negative tumors or large (\xE2\x89\xA53 cm), ER-positive tumors; they were randomized to be observed (n = 146) or to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 160) after surgery. In their study, HER2 was overexpressed in 14.3% of all tumors combined, and overexpression was higher in invasive carcinomas associated with an extensive in situ component (21.5%) than in carcinomas without a significant noninvasive or in situ histological component (11.2%; P < 0.0001). When patients with low-risk lesions not containing a significant in situ component (n = 179) were analyzed, HER2 was a strong prognostic factor. Patients in this group with HER2-positive tumors had only a 40% DFS at 5 years, compared with more than 80% in patients with HER2-negative tumors (P < 0.0001).71Using cDNA microarrays, Perou and colleagues classified invasive breast carcinomas into five subtypes based on their distinct gene expression profile (Norway/Stanford dataset).72 These included a luminal epithelial cell phenotype (subtypes A and B), a basal epithelial cell type phenotype, a HER2(+) phenotype, and a group of cancers expressing a \xE2\x80\x98 normal-like\xE2\x80\x99 gene profile. Patients whose tumors exhibited the basal-like and HER2-positive subtypes had the worst survival rates, while those with the luminal epithelial type had improved survival rates.73HER2 expression is scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+, depending on the number of cells with membrane staining and on the intensity of the staining. If the tumor is 0 or 1+, it is considered HER2-negative. If the tumor is 2+ or 3+, it is considered HER-2-positive. The humanized monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin\xC2\xAE, Genentech, CA) is used for treatment of HER2-positive patients.68,74 Since HER2 is relatively uniformly overexpressed in human breast cancers (Fig. 2a), monoclonal antibodies have been developed to the extracellular domain to treat carcinomas overexpressing HER2. Trastuzumab is also approved for treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.75A randomized phase III trial of 469 women with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 expression demonstrated that chemotherapy plus trastuzumab was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P < 0.001), a higher rate of objective response (50 percent vs. 32 percent, P < 0.001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P < 0.001), a lower rate of death at 1 year (22 percent vs. 33 percent, P = 0.008), longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months; P = 0.01), and a 20% reduction in the risk of death.68 In a phase II study, HER2 status was measured weekly in women with HER2-normal and HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer given trastuzumab and paclitaxel. Efficacy was correlated with immunohistochemical and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay results.76 HER2 status was evaluated using four different immunohistochemical assays and FISH. Patients received a median of 25 weekly infusions (range, one to 85 infusions). The intent-to-treat response rate for all 95 patients enrolled was 56.8% (95% confidence interval, 47% to 67%). A response rate of 61.4% (4.5% complete response, 56.8% partial response) was observed in 88 fully assessable patients.76 In patients with HER2-overexpressing tumors, overall response rates ranged from 67% to 81% compared with 41% to 46% in patients with HER2-normal expression (ranges reflect the different assay methods used to assess HER2 status). Differences in response rates between patients with HER2-overexpressing tumors and those with normal HER2 expression were statistically significant for all assay methods, with CB11 and TAB250 antibodies and FISH having the strongest significance. Given the established efficacy of trastuzumab for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, the HER2 testing will continue to be used as a standard laboratory test in breast cancer clinics.p53The p53 tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17p13, has a regulatory function in the defense against various kinds of cancer, including breast cancer.77\xE2\x80\x9383 The p53 gene transcription is activated by genetic, environmental, and metabolic stimuli, which direct cells to different pathways including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. It plays a central role in sensing genotoxic and non-genotoxic stresses and transducing an anti-proliferative effect80,82 (Fig. 1). p53 is activated and regulated by post-translational modifications to both the N- and C-terminal regions (e.g. phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation) and binds as a tetramer to specific DNA sequences via a central DNA-binding core region. p53 exerts its primary biologic function by modulating the transcription of dozens of genes.81,84 In mice, loss of p53 is associated with multiple spontaneous tumors77 and p53-loss accelerates the appearance of mammary tumors in murine mammary tissue that also overexpresses Myc, HER2/neu, IGF1, and/or Wnt1.85,86 Inheritance of a p53 mutant allele causes the rare familial Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by multiple early-onset cancers, including breast cancer in women who survive childhood cancers. Germline mutations in ATM and CHEK2, which are involved in p53 activation, also increase susceptibility to breast cancer.87Twenty to 35% of sporadic cases of breast cancers harbor somatic mutations in p53, based primarily on sequencing of exons 5 through 8 (the DNA-binding core), where approximately 90% of mutations are found.78,88,89 A total of 2,274 mutations in breast cancers are listed in the p53 database maintained by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.90p53, when mutated, accumulates in the nucleus of neoplastic cells. Mutation of p53 is characterized by a common amino acid substitution resulting in a shift from an arginine (Arg) to a proline (Pro) at codon 72.91 Due to increased half-life and an altered conformational structure, the mutant form of p53 protein accumulates within malignant cells. Polymorphic variants have different biological properties; for example, the Arg/Arg genotype has been reported to induce apoptosis more effectively than the Pro/Pro genotype.92\xE2\x80\x9394The significance of p53 in carcinogenesis is manifested by the frequent genetic alterations in human cancers, found as mutations within the DNA binding domain and as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the loci of the gene. Several studies have reported LOH at codon 72 with preferential loss of the Pro allele both in breast cancer and other malignancies.93,95\xE2\x80\x9397 The p53 genotype, in addition to the LOH status of codon 72, influences the prognosis in cancer. Two groups have studied this polymorphism in relation to breast cancer prognosis; they found a reduced survival for homozygous carriers of the Pro allele,98,99 consistent with the idea that the Pro72 variant of p53 is less efficient in inducing apoptosis than the Arg 72 variant.Initial studies trying to elucidate the role of a mutated p53 gene in breast cancer prognosis were based on detecting p53 accumulation using immunohistochemistry. However, even in a meta-analysis of more than 9,000 breast cancer patients, the prognostic value of the p53 overexpression appeared weak.100 Conversely, sequencing studies have shown strong prognostic significance of p53 mutations in breast cancer. In one study where p53 mutations from 1,794 European patients with at least 10 years of follow-up were analyzed, mutations in p53 exons 5 through 8 were more common in ductal and medullary tumors with an aggressive phenotype (i.e. high grade, large size, node-positive cases, and low hormone receptor content), and in women less than 60 years old. Furthermore, the presence of a mutation conferred an overall 2.27-fold increased relative risk of breast cancer-specific mortality, independently of other known prognostic markers (e.g. tumor size, node status, and ER/PR expression).101 In a comprehensive meta-analysis of 16 studies including over 3,500 patients,102 the relative hazard of dying of breast cancer for unselected patients with a p53 mutation in their tumor was 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.7\xE2\x80\x932.5). For nodenegative patients the relative hazard was 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.2\xE2\x80\x932.3), and for node-positive patients

IntroductionTamoxifen remains a first-line adjuvant treatment for premenopausal breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor-\xCE\xB1 (ER\xCE\xB1) positive tumors, and is often prescribed to postmenopausal females with ER\xCE\xB1+ tumors. Tamoxifen functions as an antagonist to ER\xCE\xB1 and blocks its signaling pathway in ER\xCE\xB1+ breast cancer cells. The risk of recurrence of breast cancer and the risk of contralateral breast cancer are significantly reduced by tamoxifen treatment. Five years of tamoxifen treatment reduced the risk of relapse after 10 years by 37% in females aged 50\xE2\x80\x9359 years, and by 54% in females aged 60\xE2\x80\x9369 years. Recently, a study showed that for patients with ER\xCE\xB1+ breast cancer, continuing tamoxifen to 10 years rather than discontinuing at five years produces a further reduction in recurrence and mortality (1). Following its introduction in the 1970s, tamoxifen has been prescribed to millions of patients with ER\xCE\xB1+ breast cancer, which accounts for ~70% of all breast cancer patients (2). Tamoxifen is now available as a generic drug worldwide, which has made it the single most prescribed drug in the world for the treatment of any cancer (2). In 1998, the USA Food and Drug Administration further approved tamoxifen as a breast cancer prevention drug for high-risk patient groups, increasing the number of females that are prescribed with tamoxifen even further.Although tamoxifen is an extremely effective treatment for breast cancer, this drug also has serious side effects. One of the most significant and detrimental side effects of postmenopausal tamoxifen treatment is its ability to increase a patient\xE2\x80\x99s chance of developing endometrial lesions, including hyperplasia, polyps, carcinomas, and sarcoma (3). The increased risk of endometrial cancer varies between studies, ranging from 1.5 to 6.9-fold (4). The risk of endometrial cancer is not associated with the daily dosage of tamoxifen, but with longer duration and accumulative usage (5). The risk of endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users increases significantly with increasing body weight among postmenopausal females (6).Independent from tamoxifen intake, breast cancer patients have an enhanced risk of endometrial proliferative disorders, including hyperplasia, as indicated by the high prevalence of this pathology detected in breast cancer patients undergoing endometrial assessment prior to the initiation of tamoxifen administration (7,8). In a recent study, the baseline hysteroscopic assessment revealed an incidence of 31.3% of overall endometrial morbidity in asymptomatic postmenopausal ER\xCE\xB1+ breast cancer patients (9). For patients who have endometrial conditions such as hyperplasia without atypia prior to tamoxifen treatment, the rate of progression to more advanced stage endometrial lesions is almost 50% after 24 months of tamoxifen administration (10).Initially, endometrial cancers induced by tamoxifen exposure were considered tumors with good prognosis. However, more recent studies have found these endometrial cancers to have a relatively poor prognosis. Endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users often belongs to the less favorable morphological subtypes, and thus may have an increased mortality (1). The three-year endometrial cancer specific survival significantly decreases from 94% for non-users to 76% for tamoxifen users of more than five years (5). In a large case-control study on the risk and prognosis of endometrial cancer following tamoxifen use for breast cancer, endometrial cancers of stage III and IV occurred more frequently in long-term tamoxifen users than non-users. In addition, long-term users experience significantly higher risks of developing malignant mixed mesodermal tumors or sarcomas of the endometrium than those not taking tamoxifen (15.4% vs. 2.9%; P<0.02). Breast cancer survivors whose endometrial carcinoma was of a high risk histological type had a longer median duration of prior tamoxifen use compared with that of those with lower risk histological types (11).As the net benefit of tamoxifen greatly outweighs the risk, the worldwide usage of tamoxifen for breast cancer patients is expected to continue, particularly as a generic drug. Therefore, lowering the risk of endometrial cancer for tamoxifen users is an increasingly important cancer prevention target. Unfortunately, since the adverse effects of endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users were reported in 1997, the current understanding of how exposure to tamoxifen affects endometrial tissue and induces endometrial cancer remains limited, despite several mechanisms being proposed. This review summarizes the current view of the possible mechanisms involved and provides an outlook for the future studies towards the prevention of development of endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users.2. Molecular mechanisms for tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancerUnlike the majority of ER\xCE\xB1+ breast cancer cells, tamoxifen induces cellular growth in endometrial cancer cells in vitro. Several signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, c-MYC and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) pathways, were elevated upon tamoxifen exposure (12). Consistent with the effects observed in in vitro cell culture, tamoxifen exposure promotes endometrial cell proliferation in vivo. A single injection of tamoxifen strongly induced an increase in uterine wet weight and proliferation in the endometrium at 16 h post-injection in mice (13). A robust induction of proliferation markers, including pRb, cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 was observed at 8\xE2\x80\x9316 h post-injection; a decrease to basal level occurs by 48 h (14). Clinical data comparing the endometrium of tamoxifen users and non-users also indicated that exposure to tamoxifen promotes endometrial proliferation. The apoptosis/proliferation index, determined by measuring the proliferation marker Ki67 and the apoptosis/anti-apoptosis markers Fas, FasL and Bcl2, is higher in the benign endometrial lesions of tamoxifen users compared with those of non-users (15,16). Recently, the BH3 mimetic drug ABT-737 was observed to partially counteract tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia (17). The combined administration of ABT-737 with tamoxifen to severe combined immunodeficiency mice for 10 days reversed the increase in uterine weight induced by tamoxifen treatment only, possibly via the promotion of apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism of the effects of BH3 mimetics in blocking tamoxifen\xE2\x80\x99s effects requires further investigation.In addition to cell proliferation, tamoxifen has been shown to promote cytoskeletal remodeling and migration in endometrial cancer cells. Tamoxifen exposure induces focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation via extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and Src signaling, and thus promotes migration (18). The effects of tamoxifen on cell migration appear to be ER signaling dependent. In ER\xCE\xB1 positive Ishikawa cells, inhibition of ER\xCE\xB1 blocks the migration effects of tamoxifen, whereas in ER negative RL95-2 endometrial cancer cells, migration is mediated through G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) and ERK/FAK pathway (19). Notably, tamoxifen not only promotes invasion of endometrial cancer cells, it more than doubles the invasion of endometrial stromal cells in a three-dimensional coculture model (20). Paracrine factors released from endometrial stromal cells are able to promote epithelial proliferation of endometrial cells (21), emphasizing the importance of stromal cells in endometrial carcinogenesis. These results clearly demonstrate the role of tamoxifen on endometrial stromal cells, and raise the possibility that tamoxifen promotes endometrial cancer partially through its effects in the stroma.3. DNA damage induced by tamoxifenTamoxifen is metabolized to an array of metabolites with estrogenic effects, and also to reactive intermediates that may form protein or DNA adducts to cause DNA damage. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that tamoxifen induces malignancies by its genotoxicity. Tamoxifen is known as a strong liver carcinogen in rats (22\xE2\x80\x9325), and a high frequency of p53 mutations is detected in hepatocarcinomas induced by tamoxifen exposure (26). Intraperitoneal administration of tamoxifen to female mice leads to the formation of hepatic DNA adducts (27). However, analysis of tamoxifen (Tam)-DNA adducts in endometrial tissues from patients treated with tamoxifen has yielded mixed results. Several studies failed to detect Tam-DNA adducts in endometrial tissue (28,29), in contrast with a number of other studies (30,31). In addition, Tam-DNA adduct formation has been detected in glandular and surface epithelia following the incubation of human endometrial explants with tamoxifen (32). While Tam-DNA adduct formation is possible in human tissues, compelling evidence that this dri

Furthermore, the risk of developing hepatocellular cancer is minimal in females treated with tamoxifen, and Tam-DNA adduct formation in endometrial tissue occurs at an extremely low level and in only a few females. Consistent with the lack of DNA damage effects on tamoxifen-associated endometrial tissue, a large scale chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization analysis comparing the genomic profile of endometrial tumors from long-term (>2 year) tamoxifen exposed and unexposed breast cancer patients revealed that the genomic aberrations are indistinguishable in the two groups (33). Instead, genomic profiles are correlated with morphological subtypes of the endometrial tumors (33). Therefore, the importance of genotoxity as a major pathway for tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancer is unclear.4. Effects of tamoxifen on driver genes of sporadic endometrial cancerSeveral genes have been shown to be associated with sporadic endometrial cancer. One of the most common genetic alterations is the mutation or loss of heterozygosity in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene, which occurs in 35\xE2\x80\x9350% of type I endometrial carcinoma. Other common DNA alterations include increased microsatellite instability (MSI), due to defects in DNA mismatch repair family genes, and gene mutations in K-ras (34), \xCE\xB2-catenin and p53. Mutation of the K-ras protooncogene occurs most frequently in codons 12 and 13 of exon 1, and has been detected in 4.5\xE2\x80\x9323% of endometrial hyperplasia and in 18\xE2\x80\x9326% of endometrial carcinomas (35,36). \xCE\xB2-catenin mutations are present in 14\xE2\x80\x9344% of type I endometrial cancers, and mutations in MSI are identified in 20\xE2\x80\x9340% of type I endometrial carcinomas, and frequently coexist with PTEN mutations. Sequencing and analysis of genetic mutations of these genes in tissue samples of tamoxifen-associated and sporadic endometrial cancer patients have been conducted by a number of research groups. In the majority of cases, patients with tamoxifen exposure had similar mutation rates in PTEN, p53, and MSI genes as non-exposed females with endometrial cancer (37\xE2\x80\x9340).The frequency of K-ras mutation in tamoxifen-related endometrial polyps is controversial; the incidence was reported to be high (43\xE2\x80\x9364%) in certain cases compared with the 4.5\xE2\x80\x9323% observed with non-users (41,42). Furthermore, the presence of the K-ras mutation is significantly affected by the duration of tamoxifen treatment (43). Conversely, in other reports, no significant difference was observed between tamoxifen-treated and non-treated patients (37\xE2\x80\x9339). Similarly, higher p53 mutation or overexpression rates were reported in several studies (5,39), but not in others (44). \xCE\xB2-catenin mutation rates may be elevated in tamoxifen-treated females (38), however, the results are also inconsistent. The likelihood of tamoxifen increasing endometrial cancer rate by enhancing mutations of driver genes for sporadic endometrial cancer is low. Instead, long-term tamoxifen exposure is likely to promote endometrial carcinogenesis predominantly via non-genomic alterations. It is possible that tamoxifen offers endometrial cells that contain pre-existing mutations a growth advantage via estrogenic and epigenetic alterations. The result of these activities is a significant increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer in long-term tamoxifen users.5. Estrogenic effects of tamoxifenIn breast cancer cells, tamoxifen acts as an ER antagonist by competing with estrodiol for binding, and by inducing conformational changes that block the interaction of ER with co-activator proteins (45). However, as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), tamoxifen behaves as an antagonist and/or agonist of ER, depending on the target tissue, and can modulate the signal transduction pathways of estrogen-responsive genes. In endometrial tissue, tamoxifen is known to exert estrogenic actions.One mechanism that may explain the antagonistic and agonistic effects of tamoxifen in different target tissues is the differential recruitment of co-regulators to the ER target gene promoter. In breast cancer cells, tamoxifen induces the recruitment of co-repressors nuclear receptor co-repressor and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors to ER target promoters (12). However, in the endometrium, tamoxifen recruits the co-activators steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1), amplified in breast cancer-1 (AIB1) and CREB-binding protein (CBP), rather than co-repressors, to ER target gene (12). Inhibition of SRC-1 in Ishikawa cells eliminated tamoxifen-induced gene expression (12). This differential co-regulator recruitment appears to be limited to ER targets that do not contain a classical estrogen response element (ERE) in their promoters, including c-MYC and IGF1 (12). The tissue-dependent mode of action of tamoxifen may be explained by the relative abundance of co-factors in different tissues (46). The expression level of co-regulators such as SRC-1 is low in MCF7 breast cancer cells compared with endometrial Ishikawa cells (12). In addition, SRC-1 activity is regulated by Src kinase, which is highly activated in endometrial cancer cells compared with breast cancer cells (47). However, this mechanism only partially explains the differences observed between breast and endometrial cancer cells, as tamoxifen did not display agonistic effects in all estrogen target genes, indicating the involvement of other molecular mechanisms.As well as affecting the transcriptional activity of ER\xCE\xB1, tamoxifen has been shown to regulate expression levels of ER\xCE\xB1 in the endometrium. Several studies have demonstrated that the expression of ER\xCE\xB1 in benign endometrium is higher in breast cancer patients who use tamoxifen compared to non-tamoxifen-users (48,15), thereby promoting estrogen-mediated cell growth. Conversely, decreased ER\xCE\xB1 expression on endometrial cancer has also been reported. Over 60% of long term tamoxifen users are ER\xCE\xB1 negative in endometrium, whereas only 26.2% of non-users are ER\xCE\xB1 negative (5). This observation is consistent with the evidence that mice orally dosed with tamoxifen during early development showed a marked decrease in expression of ER\xCE\xB1, with no or very weak staining in the endometrium, stroma and myometrium (49). An explanation for this discrepancy may be that, in the cells with downregulated ER\xCE\xB1, upregulation of other ER splice variants or isoforms by tamoxifen exposure compensated for the loss of ER\xCE\xB1. ER-\xCE\xB136, a variant form of ER\xCE\xB1 that is localized to the plasma membrane, has been shown to be upregulated in endometrial cancer cells (50). The expression of ER-\xCE\xB136 increases with tamoxifen exposure in endometrial cancer cells (50). In addition, ER-\xCE\xB136 mediates the tamoxifen-induced MAPK and Akt pathways, and is essential for tamoxifen-stimulated endometrial cell growth (50).Other than activating nuclear estrogen receptors to induce downstream genomic signaling, estrogen is also known to activate rapid non-genomic signaling events independently of nuclear ER. GPR30, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, has been proposed to be a new membrane-bound estrogen receptor involved in the rapid non-genomic effects of estrogen. GPR30 activation leads to the release of heparin-bound growth factor (HB-EGF), which in turn triggers the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/MAPK transduction pathway (51). In endometrial cancer, overexpression of GPR30 occurs more frequently in high-grade and advanced stage tumors, and is correlated with poor prognosis (52).Tamoxifen acts as an agonist for GPR30 to stimulate cell proliferation and growth. GPR30 mediates tamoxifen\xE2\x80\x99s stimulatory effects on endometrial carcinoma cells in vitro, possibly through stimulation of MAPK phosphorylation (53). Inhibition of GPR30 eliminates the tamoxifen-stimulated proliferation of endometrial cancer cells (53). More importantly, a significant correlation between GPR30 expression and tamoxifen-induced endometrial pathology has been identified (54). A cohort study comparing the expression pattern of GPR30 in endometrial tissue from breast cancer patients who received tamoxifen, or another adjuvant therapy, showed that the intensity of GPR30 expression was significantly correlated with the time between the initiation of tamoxifen treatment and the development of an endometrial abnormality. Among tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients, 43.8% exhibited high-grade GPR30 staining, whereas only 13.6% were observed in control group (54).6. Tamoxifen-regulated genes exhibit an overlapping but distinct profile compared with the target genes of estradiolStudies utilizing different model systems have been conducted to systematically determine the molecular pathways affected by tamoxifen and estradiol in vitro and in vivo. These studies have indicated that, although there is an overlap between the tamoxifen- and estradiol-induced gene expression profiles, tamoxifen also regulates its own specific set of genes in endometrial cells.In a study by Tamm-Rosenstein et al (55), the endometrial Ishikawa cancer cell line was treated with tamoxifen or estradiol for 12 h, followed by RNA-sequencing. Tamoxifen exposure altered the expression of 1013 genes. Among them, only 224 (22%) genes overlapped with estradiol treatment; all others were tamoxifen-specific gene targets, in pathways including DNA replication, recombination and repair, in addition to cell cycle progression, and cellular assembly and organization. Notably, while tamoxifen is often considered an agonist to estrogen in endometrial cells, the transcriptome results indicate that tamoxifen is both antagonistic and agonistic in the Ishikawa cell line. Similarly, a study utilizing primary cultures of human endometrial epithel
2016-05-22T09:35:34.100602+00:00 app[web.1]: ial cultures showed that the majority of genes altered by tamoxifen treatment for 24 hrs were estrogen-independent (56). Fong et al (13) injected a single dose of tamoxifen or ethinylestradiol to immature ovariectomized mice, and observed a significant increase in uterine wet weight after 24 h. Microarray analysis revealed that tamoxifen and ethinylestradiol target genes overlapped but tamoxifen also independently regulated genes associated with cell growth and proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, extracellular matrix modification, nucleotide synthesis, DNA replication, protein synthesis and turnover, lipid metabolism, glycolysis and immunological responses (13). Furthermore, microarray analysis of endometrial patient tissues revealed that 67% of tamoxifen-regulated genes overlap with estradiol treatment (13). Notably, these investigators found that tamoxifen uses the same set of cell cycle genes as estradiol to promote cell proliferation in endometrial tissue, however, it does so to a lesser extent (57).The majority of experiments aimed at understanding the mechanism of tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancer are performed with short exposure to tamoxifen, ranging from 16\xE2\x80\x9372 h post single administration. The results obtained through these methods aid in the identification of immediate targets of tamoxifen on endometrial cells. However, the association of endometrial cancer incidence rate with duration of tamoxifen exposure indicates that long-term exposure of tamoxifen has additional promoting effects on endometrial carcinogenesis. As endometrial carcinogenesis is a progressive and not a sudden event, short-term exposure of endometrial cells to tamoxifen is not likely to reveal all of the signaling pathways that are critical for tamoxifen-promoted endometrial cancer. To understand the effects of long-term tamoxifen exposure on endometrial tissue, analyses of gene expression profile from large scale clinical data and experiments with long-term treatment of tamoxifen are required.To date, only small scale studies comparing the gene expression profiles of tamoxifen-associated and sporadic endometrial cancers from patient samples have been undertaken. In one study, no differences were observed in the gene-expression profile when tamoxifen-induced cancers were matched for grade and stage to non-tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancers; this may have been due to the small number of tumor samples (58). However, another study with stage-matched patient tissue microarray revealed that gene expression profiles in endometrial tumors are different in tamoxifen users compared with non-users (59). Unsupervised clustering of all genes in all samples revealed that tumors from patients who had used tamoxifen clustered together, and were separate from samples of those who had never used tamoxifen. This study identified 256 differently expressed genes, the majority of which were tamoxifen-specific. Notably, a number of these gene products, including p53, RelA, MYC, EGFR and \xCE\xB2-catenin, are critical components of pathways that, based on their normal physiological functions, may be important in endometrial carcinogenesis (59). Furthermore, these genes have also been shown to be upregulated and modulate tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, indicating that long-term treatment with tamoxifen may stimulate similar gene networks to promote cancer progression in endometrial cells and overcome sensitivity in breast cancer cells.7. UPR-mTOR-autophagy signaling pathwayThe study of endocrine resistance in breast cancer has demonstrated that the UPR signaling pathway is often activated by endocrine therapeutic interventions (60). Upon endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress, the chaperone protein GRP78 is released from sensor proteins and thus activates three distinct arms of the UPR pathway: IRE1-XBP1, PERK-eIF2\xCE\xB1 and ATF6. The pro-survival UPR pathway is temporarily activated to protect cells against EnR stress in normal cells; however, it is often constantly upregulated in cancer cells, promoting survival. The UPR components such as XBP1 and GRP78 are highly expressed in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells that have undergone long-term exposure to tamoxifen or faslodex (61,62). Faslodex is a pure ER antagonist that activates the degradation of the receptor protein. The activated UPR is essential in regulating cell fate via modulation of apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells (61). As the effects of long-term tamoxifen exposure on the induction of the UPR signaling pathway in breast cancer cells are often ER-independent, it is reasonable to predict that long-term tamoxifen exposure may induce UPR signaling in endometrial cells in a similar manner. The activated UPR signaling may promote cell survival and evasion of apoptosis, which are essential for cancer progression in endometrial tissue.Consistent with this hypothesis, tamoxifen treatment induces the expression of EnR stress chaperone GRP78 in glandular and surface epithelia in human endometrial explants, indicating the activation of EnR stress/UPR signaling pathway in these cells (32). Our preliminary data, showing that the endometrial tissue of long-term tamoxifen-treated rats expresses higher levels of UPR component genes phosphor-eIF2\xCE\xB1 and CHOP compared with non-tamoxifen-treated control rats (unpublished data), also support this hypothesis. In breast cancer cells, GRP78 has been shown to modulate mTOR activity to promote autophagy (61). A number of studies have suggested that the mTOR signaling pathway is important in tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer. The mean expression of mTOR in tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer patients was significantly higher compared with the non-tamoxifen group (63). Addition of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) can prevent tamoxifen-associated endometrial hyperplasia in mice, and significantly decreases proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining promoted by tamoxifen in the epithelial and glandular cells (64). In addition, RAD001 decreases endometrial stromal cell proliferation in the tamoxifen-treated mice, which is known to send paracrine signals to promote the proliferation of endometrial epithelial cells (64). Further investigation to determine the role of EnR stress-UPR-mTOR-autophagy signaling pathway in tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer, particularly following long-term exposure, is urgently required to provide insight for the development of cancer prevention strategies for patients taking tamoxifen.The blockage of pathways that are essential for endocrine resistance in breast and tamoxifen-associated endometrial carcinogenesis is of tremendous value in clinical cancer prevention. As tamoxifen is a proven effective therapeutic and preventive drug for breast cancer, targeting the two major hurdles that limit its clinical usage is of significant benefit to breast cancer patients. The EnR stress-UPR signaling pathway may be an ideal target if proven to be critical for tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that the physiology and homeostasis of the EnR and UPR signaling pathway are associated with obesity. Specifically, the IRE1\xCE\xB1-XBP1 branch of the UPR pathway has been demonstrated to be crucial in glucose and lipid metabolism in addition to insulin function. Obesity is an established risk factor for both breast cancer and endometrial cancer. Therefore, in addition to the direct effects on endocrine resistance in breast cancer and tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancer, blocking the UPR pathway has the potential to benefit tamoxifen users indirectly through inhibition of obesity.8. ConclusionsTamoxifen is the most widely used breast cancer therapy and preventative drug worldwide. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of tamoxifen-promoted endometrial cancer is essential to identify strategies to lower the risk of developing endometrial cancer for breast cancer patients being treated with tamoxifen. Since tamoxifen metabolites may be genotoxic, tamoxifen functions primarily through non-genomic pathways to promote endometrial carcinogenesis. The modulation of estrogenic pathways is important in mediating the cell proliferation promoting effects of tamoxifen in endometrial cells. In addition, tamoxifen is known to regulate gene targets that are independent of estrogen. However, the tamoxifen-specific gene targets or networks that are essential for long-term tamoxifen exposure-induced endometrial cancer remain to be determined. Recent studies and our own data indicate that UPR and mTOR signaling may be significant in long-term tamoxifen exposure-induced endometrial cancer. As these two pathways are also major contributors to the mediation of endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells, targeting them may benefit tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients by reducing endocrine resistance, as well as endometrial cancers following long-term usage. Larger scale clinical gene profile data and long-term tamoxifen experiments with in vitro and in vivo animal studies are needed to further clarify the involvement of these two pathways and molecular mechanisms that are essential for tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer.\",\"id\":\"4c0667ec-d8ae-4e32-a306-c9ea55b53f79\",\"_version_\":1534947964210905088},{\"nlmTa\":\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"all\":[\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"2005\",\"2005-7-29\",\"BioMed Central\",\"London\",\"16168100\",\"1242155\",\"CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen response\",\"7\",\"5\"],\"ppub\":\"2005\",\"epub\":\"2005-7-29\",\"publisherName\":\"BioMed Central\",\"publisherLoc\":\"London\",\"pmid\":16168100,\"pmc\":1242155,\"articleTitle\":\"CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen response\",\"volume\":7,\"issue\":5,\"body\":\"We read with interest the article by Wegman and coworkers [1] entitled 'Genotype of metabolic enzymes and the benefit of tamoxifen in postmenopausal breast cancer patients'.

Rather, we believe that alternative interpretations of the data may shed a different light on their conclusions. First, it is important to understand the patients included in this study. They began with a subset of patients (226/679 [33%]) treated in an adjuvant tamoxifen trial designed to compare the effects of tamoxifen (40 mg/day for 2 years) alone or with chemotherapy, and with or without radiation. Of these, only 112 patients received tamoxifen and only 71 were ER positive. Thus, only 10.5% of patients in the overall trial (71/679) were included in this small substudy, meaning that there is great potential for selection bias.Initially, the authors did not find a difference in outcome by CYP2D6*4 genotype, and therefore they compared the outcomes in patients with at least one CYP2D6*4 allele who received tamoxifen (n = 24) versus no tamoxifen (n = 23). They found that patients with the CYP2D6*4 genotype did significantly better than patients not treated with tamoxifen and observed a similar trend in women with the SULT1A1*1 homozygous genotype. They concluded that genotyping of these enzymes may be useful in predicting clinical outcomes and that their findings were in contrast to the current hypotheses on the role of metabolic enzymes in tamoxifen activation and inactivation.We believe the data presented are consistent with our results, which suggest that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may experience less benefit from tamoxifen treatment [2]. It is expected that ER-positive women treated with tamoxifen will have better outcomes than ER-positive women treated without tamoxifen, even if they have one CYP2D6*4 allele, because this group would not completely eliminate the benefits of tamoxifen. Indeed, it appears that the data presented by Wegman and coworkers are consistent with this hypothesis, albeit the numbers are very small because of the considerable subsetting and selection.Our studies have shown that the serum concentration of an active metabolite of tamoxifen, namely endoxifen, is effected by CYP2D6 status in a gene dose dependent manner, with low, intermediate and high concentrations in homozygous variant, heterozygous and homozygous wild-type patients, respectively [3,4]. Furthermore, data from a large randomized trial of postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years [2] indicate that women who are homozygous (but not heterozygous) for the CYP2D6*4 allele have significantly worse relapse-free survival and disease-free survivals than do women who are heterozygous or homozygous for the common allele. These findings suggest that the outcome of women with 'intermediate' concentrations of endoxifen, as represented by the heterozygous CYP2D6*4, are no different than women who carry two wild-type CYP2D6 alleles. This suggests that the clinical effect of tamoxifen is due to multiple metabolites, and only when women carry two null CYP2D6 alleles, corresponding to the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype, do outcomes deteriorate.Competing interestsThe authors(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\",\"id\":\"0f7f2b39-430e-4a60-ba17-52246181b789\",\"_version_\":1534948553677340673},{\"nlmTa\":\"J Adv Pract Oncol\",\"all\":[\"J Adv Pract Oncol\",\"J Adv Pract Oncol\",\"Journal of the advanced practitioner in oncology\",\"2014\",\"2014-1-1\",\"Harborside Press\",\"\",\"25032035\",\"4093467\",\"The Long and Short of Tamoxifen Therapy: A Review of the ATLAS Trial\",\"5\",\"1\",\"57\",\"60\"],\"isoAbbrev\":\"J Adv Pract Oncol\",\"journalTitle\":\"Journal of the advanced practitioner in oncology\",\"ppub\":\"2014\",\"epub\":\"2014-1-1\",\"publisherName\":\"Harborside Press\",\"publisherLoc\":\"\",\"pmid\":25032035,\"pmc\":4093467,\"articleTitle\":\"The Long and Short of Tamoxifen Therapy: A Review of the ATLAS Trial\",\"volume\":5,\"issue\":1,\"fpage\":57,\"lpage\":60,\"body\":\"Since the early 1990s, the mortality rate associated with breast cancer has been declining in all industrialized nations. This continuing decline has been attributed to the implementation of more widespread breast cancer screening practices as well as advancements in systemic therapy, including chemotherapy and adjuvant hormonal therapy (Peto, Boreham, Clarke, Davies, & Beral, 2000).The concept of manipulating the female hormonal environment for the treatment of breast cancer dates back to the late 1800s. Several physicians at that time, including George Thomas Beatson, a Glasgow surgeon, disagreed with the prevailing theory of breast cancer as a parasitic disease. Beatson had been studying the castration of cattle for the purpose of prolonging lactation and hypothesized that manipulation of the hormonal system through oophorectomy in a premenopausal woman with advanced breast cancer might be of benefit. In an article originally published in The Lancet in 1896, Beatson reported the case studies of three young patients with advanced breast cancer who agreed to undergo bilateral oophorectomy. In his article, he described how two of the three women had remarkable decreases in their disease burden and increased palliation for some period of time following oophorectomy (Beatson, 1896).Hormonal ManipulationThe concept of hormonal manipulation continued to attract scientific interest. In the 1960s through the 1970s, tamoxifen, a drug that was initially evaluated (unsuccessfully) as a postcoital contraceptive medication, continued to be investigated and was found to improve progression-free survival in women with advanced breast cancer (Cole, Jones, & Todd, 1971). This led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of tamoxifen in the metastatic setting in 1977. In subsequent trials, tamoxifen was proven effective in the adjuvant treatment setting (Fisher et al., 1989).Tamoxifen acts as a competitor with estrogen for the binding site of the estrogen receptor within breast tissue. Tamoxifen became the first FDA-approved selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for the treatment of breast cancer. Today, it is utilized not only in the adjuvant and metastatic treatment settings, but it was also the first FDA-approved chemopreventive agent for those deemed at high risk for the development of breast cancer (Fisher et al., 1998).Questions of Optimal DurationThe question of optimal duration of adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, and more specifically tamoxifen, has been under ongoing investigation for decades. Many trials of varying durations of adjuvant tamoxifen were conducted. In 1998, a meta-analysis of adjuvant tamoxifen trials was reported by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists\xE2\x80\x99 Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). In the 55 clinical trials reviewed (consisting of about 30,000 women), with durations of 1, 2, and about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the proportional recurrence reductions produced during about 10 years of follow-up were 21% (standard deviation [SD] 3), 29% (SD 2), and 47% (SD 3), respectively (p < .00001). The corresponding proportional breast cancer mortality reductions were 12% (SD 3), 17% (SD 3), and 26% (SD 4), respectively (p = .003; EBCTCG, 1998).NSABP B-14 was one of the pivotal randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials looking at 5 years of tamoxifen vs placebo in operable, estrogen receptor\xE2\x80\x93positive, lymph node\xE2\x80\x93negative breast cancer patients. Through 10 years of follow-up, disease-free survival (DFS) was superior in the tamoxifen arm vs. the placebo arm: 69% vs. 57% (p < .0001). Distant DFS was 76% vs. 67%, respectively (p < .0001). Overall survival trended in favor of the treatment arm: 80% vs. 76% (p = .02).In 1987, an extension of B-14 commenced to investigate a longer duration of adjuvant tamoxifen. Patients on the tamoxifen arm of B-14 and disease-free at 5 years were reassigned to an additional 5 years of tamoxifen therapy vs. placebo. For patients on the placebo arm as compared with the tamoxifen arm, ongoing follow-up revealed an advantage beyond 5 years in terms of DFS, 92% vs. 86% (p = .003); distant DFS, 96% vs. 90% (p = .01); and overall survival, 96% vs. 94% (p = .08; Fisher et al., 1996). Therefore, the standard of care for the duration of adjuvant tamoxifen became 5 years of therapy.The ATLAS TrialDespite the findings of the extension portion of the B-14 trial, additional adjuvant tamoxifen duration trials continued. The ATLAS (Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter) study was an international trial, enrolling over 12,000 patients from 1996 to 2005 from 36 countries or regions.Study Design\xC2\xA0Eligibility criteria were having resectable disease that was completely excised, being currently on tamoxifen for 5 years, or having stopped tamoxifen within the past year and being able to easily resume therapy. Participants had to have no evidence of distant metastasis at the time of enrollment. 90% of the participants were postmenopausal women. The two treatment arms were the continuation of tamoxifen for an additional 5 years of therapy vs. placebo. No restrictions were placed on age, histology, hormone receptor status, nodal status, or other treatments (Davies et al., 2013).Outcomes Analysis\xC2\xA0Of those study patients initially enrolled, 6,846 were confirmed to have estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease and were included in the breast cancer\xE2\x80\x93related outcomes analysis. In both study groups, 91% of survivors were still being followed 10 years after diagnosis, and 77% were still being followed 15 years after diagnosis. Comparing the tamoxifen arm with the placebo arm, the risk of recurrence in years 5 through 14 was 21.4% vs. 25.1%, respectiv
2016-05-22T09:35:34.100602+00:00 app[web.1]: ely, and breast cancer\xE2\x80\x93specific mortality was 12.2% vs. 15%, respectively, equating to an absolute breast cancer mortality reduction of 2.8%. It is important to note that longer follow-up was needed to ascertain the full benefits of extending tamoxifen treatment beyond 5 years. The reduction in the risk of breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer\xE2\x80\x93related mortality was greater after year 10 following diagnosis, meeting statistical significance, and less so between years 5 and 9.In terms of compliance to the study arms at 2 years into enrollment in the ATLAS trial, 84% of those allocated to continue on tamoxifen were compliant compared with 96% of controls (4% of control patients had initiated adjuvant hormonal therapy, predominantly tamoxifen). The researchers surmised that with 100% compliance to therapy, the benefits of longer adjuvant tamoxifen would be even greater. The EBCTCG is expected to report a meta-analysis of longer-duration tamoxifen trials, including data not only from ATLAS but from the aTTom (Adjuvant Tamoxifen Treatment Offers More) trial and other smaller trials as well.Side Effects\xC2\xA0The most common side effects of tamoxifen therapy are postmenopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats; vaginal dryness, discharge, or irritation; and irregular menses. These toxicities can range from mild to severe, at times significantly affecting quality of life. These side effects were not discussed within the Davies et al. article, but they have been well described in previous tamoxifen trials (Day et al., 1999).In terms of life-threatening toxicities, the two most commonly seen with tamoxifen therapy are risk of a secondary endometrial cancer and increased risk of a thromboembolic event. For the analysis of adverse events within the ATLAS trial, all 12,894 enrolled study patients were included. The most noteworthy events included the increased risk of a pulmonary embolus, for which the event rate ratio (RR) was 1.87 (p = .01). In terms of a secondary endometrial cancer, the event rate ratio was 1.74 (p = .0002). The incidence of endometrial cancer was 3.1% in the tamoxifen arm vs. 1.6% in the placebo group. Endometrial cancer\xE2\x80\x93related mortality was 0.4% in the tamoxifen arm vs. 0.2% in the placebo arm. Despite the increased risk of a thromboembolic event or a secondary endometrial cancer, the expected benefits of tamoxifen therapy in terms of reduction of breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer\xE2\x80\x93related mortality outweighed the expected toxicities and potential negative outcomes.Compliance\xC2\xA0As noted earlier, the compliance rate for tamoxifen-randomized patients was around 84% at year 7 of tamoxifen therapy. This finding is not unexpected and is consistent with compliance rates noted in previously published adjuvant tamoxifen trials (Makubate, Donnan, Dewar, Thompson, & McCowan, 2013). The impact on quality of life in terms of toxicities such as postmenopausal symptoms is not to be underestimated. Concern about life-threatening adverse events such as thromboembolic events or secondary endometrial cancers has also kept patients from initiating and/or completing adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. If the absolute benefit in terms of decrease in breast cancer\xE2\x80\x93related mortality of an additional 5 years of tamoxifen therapy is only 2.8%, a balanced discussion needs to occur weighing the benefits of therapy vs. the impact on quality of life and potential life-threatening toxicities.Other Antiestrogen TherapiesOther antiestrogen therapy options, such as aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and results from clinical trials in which patients switch from tamoxifen to an AI or vice versa with varying schedules and durations of therapy have confounded a clear path as to the optimal drug(s) and duration of adjuvant antiestrogen therapy.One pivotal trial in this arena was the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial, which provided data in favor of an AI vs. tamoxifen taken for 5 years (Cuzick et al., 2010). The AI anastrozole was found to be superior to tamoxifen in terms of improving DFS in postmenopausal women (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval = 0.78\xE2\x80\x930.95; p = .003).MA.17 was a clinical trial that randomized postmenopausal women to 5 years of letrozole therapy vs. placebo following 5 years of tamoxifen therapy (Goss et al., 2005). With a median follow-up of 30 months, women on letrozole saw improvement in terms of DFS compared to placebo (HR, 0.58; p < .001). There is now an extension portion of MA.17 randomizing those on the letrozole arm of MA.17 to an additional 5 years of therapy vs. placebo. The results of the extension portion of MA.17 are not yet known.In 2010, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) updated its adjuvant breast cancer guideline to recommend that all postmenopausal women with hormone receptor\xE2\x80\x93positive breast cancer use an AI either alone or before or after tamoxifen to reduce their risk of recurrence. The guideline updates went on to say that women may also use AIs for extended periods, after 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, to lower their risk of recurrence (Burstein et al., 2010).ConclusionFor postmenopausal women, the decision to initiate tamoxifen or AI therapy up front may be based on stage of disease, risk of recurrence, age, comorbidities, or personal choice. If tamoxifen is initially started, the ASCO guidelines recommend switching to an AI at some time point during the course of antiestrogen therapy. For premenopausal women, tamoxifen, now in a duration of 10 years, may provide a viable option to further decrease the risk of breast cancer recurrence. The expectation is that more clinical trials and longer follow-up will continue to guide clinicians regarding the optimal therapy and duration of adjuvant antiestrogen therapy.\",\"id\":\"ec998f0e-28c0-47e6-9933-5642c0051d10\",\"_version_\":1534951661430112258},{\"nlmTa\":\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"all\":[\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"Breast Cancer Research : BCR\",\"2005\",\"2005-5-27\",\"BioMed Central\",\"\",\"4231903\",\"Tamoxifen resistance and adjuvant hormone therapy\",\"7\"],\"isoAbbrev\":\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"journalTitle\":\"Breast Cancer Research : BCR\",\"ppub\":\"2005\",\"epub\":\"2005-5-27\",\"publisherName\":\"BioMed Central\",\"publisherLoc\":\"\",\"pmc\":4231903,\"articleTitle\":\"Tamoxifen resistance and adjuvant hormone therapy\",\"volume\":7,\"body\":\"The Oxford Overview of adjuvant endocrine trials [1] indicates that 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces recurrence by 41% and deaths by 34% in women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. At 5 years, in all patients studied, the recurrence rate was 25.8% in controls but 13.9% on tamoxifen. There was a substantial 'carry over' effect of tamoxifen such that even after 15 years of follow up mortality was about 30% less in tamoxifen-treated patients. The effect of tamoxifen was greater in patients with ER-positive, PR-positive as compared with ER-positive PR-negative tumours. These data indicate a substantial effect of tamoxifen but it is clear that approximately half of patients are resistant to tamoxifen de novo (early relapses) or acquire resistance if we assume that women who relapsed later had an initial response to tamoxifen. The potential reasons for resistance include activated growth factor pathways overriding the inhibitory effects of the drug either via nuclear or membrane ER. Of ER-positive PR-negative tumours, 30% are HER1/2-positive, as compared with about 10% of ER-positive PR-positive tumours, and this difference may account for their lower activity of tamoxifen in PR-negative tumours. Modern aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are more effective in reducing relapse compared with tamoxifen whether AI treatment is initiated after surgery (ATAC and BIG1-98 trials) or after 2\xE2\x80\x933 years of tamoxifen (ITA, ARNO/ABCSG). At present, it is difficult to distinguish any differences in effectiveness between the three agents used in these trials (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) but small differences in toxicity patterns are beginning to emerge. The reason for the greater effectiveness of AIs is not clear. In randomized studies of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy [2] and in the anastrozole adjuvant trials (ATAC and ARNO/ABCSG) [3], the AIs used were particularly more active than tamoxifen in the ER-positive PR-negative subgroup of tumours, but this was not seen in the BIG1-98 and IES trials. Studies on letrozole resistant human mammary tumour cell lines show that growth factor pathways such as MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) are activated, and sensitivity to the AI can be restored by growth factor pathway inhibitors [4]. Also, AI resistance can be reduced by combined treatment with fulvestrant in animal models. These data suggest mechanisms whereby AI resistance may be circumvented in patients and point to new approaches to adjuvant treatment.\",\"id\":\"6b9b0751-6d0b-4777-afee-67eed9c7ddd7\",\"_version_\":1534949125487853570},{\"nlmTa\":\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"all\":[\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"Breast Cancer Research : BCR\",\"2009\",\"2009-6-23\",\"BioMed Central\",\"\",\"4284879\",\"Controversies in the hormonal adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal patients\",\"11\"],\"isoAbbrev\":\"Breast Cancer Res\",\"journalTitle\":\"Breast Cancer Research : BCR\",\"ppub\":\"2009\",\"epub\":\"2009-6-23\",\"publisherName\":\"BioMed Central\",\"publisherLoc\":\"\",\"pmc\":4284879,\"articleTitle\":\"Controversies in the hormonal adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal patients\",\"volume\":11,\"body\":\"Over 80% of primary breast cancers in postmenopausal women present as ER+.

2016-05-22T09:35:34.100602+00:00 app[web.1]: subgroups [1]. Recent data from the BIG1-98 trial [2] revealed that initial therapy with tamoxifen with a switch after 2 years to letrozole was not as effective as continued letrozole, an important refutation of earlier modelling that suggested the sequential approach might be at least as effective as 5 years' AI treatment. The indication that 2 years of letrozole followed by 3 years of tamoxifen therapy is as effective as 5 years of letrozole provokes new thinking about the possible best use of these agents.Tamoxifen has some serious side effects (for example, increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism) that AIs do not, but the deleterious bone and joint effects of AIs make tamoxifen a continued choice of treatment in some patients, particularly those at low risk of relapse.The early indications that AIs might be relatively more effective than tamoxifen in PgR- versus PgR+ patients and HER2+ versus HER2- tumours have not been confirmed. Similarly, the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) showed similar relationships with risk of distant recurrence in both anastrozole and tamoxifen arms of the ATAC trial. Although data from BIG1-98 show a greater effect of AIs over tamoxifen at higher levels of Ki67, there is no significant interaction between the Ki67 and treatment effects \xE2\x80\x93 suggesting that this is largely an effect of high Ki67 being associated with poorer prognosis. There are conflicting data on whether polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene, which reduce the efficiency of conversion of tamoxifen to the more potent endoxifen, indicate a poorer efficacy for tamoxifen and therefore greater relative benefit from an AI.The decision to deliver adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to endocrine treatment is judged largely on the basis of prognosis after considering the impact of the endocrine therapy. While the RS is a validated instrument for this purpose, the prognostic effect of markers such as PgR, HER2 and Ki67 is substantial and may allow the development of widely applicable immunohistochemical approaches to risk evaluation.\",\"id\":\"e974ca39-a66f-42b5-92ec-7bfe571370a4\",\"_version_\":1534952804912726017},{\"nlmTa\":\"Br J Cancer\",\"all\":[\"Br J Cancer\",\"2003-03-10\",\"2003-03-04\",\"Nature Publishing Group\",\"\",\"12618879\",\"2376344\",\"The influence of tamoxifen treatment on the oestrogen receptor in metachronous contralateral breast cancer\",\"88\",\"5\",\"707\",\"710\"],\"ppub\":\"2003-03-10\",\"epub\":\"2003-03-04\",\"publisherName\":\"Nature Publishing Group\",\"publisherLoc\":\"\",\"pmid\":12618879,\"pmc\":2376344,\"articleTitle\":\"The influence of tamoxifen treatment on the oestrogen receptor in metachronous contralateral breast cancer\",\"volume\":88,\"issue\":5,\"fpage\":707,\"lpage\":710,\"body\":\"Tamoxifen as an antioestrogenic drug was introduced in the seventies and is now widely used as adjuvant and palliative treatment in breast cancer patients. Tamoxifen use as adjuvant treatment prevents new breast cancers or delays disease progression. The drug blocks the binding of oestrogens to the human oestradiol receptors (ER), which are specific proteins in the human breast cell. Oestrogens have, by means of the ER, a proliferating effect on breast cancer cells. The presence of the receptor is a predictor of the endocrine responsiveness of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen (De Placido et al, 1990; Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), 1998; Chlebowski et al, 1999; Radmacher et al, 2000).In the EBCTCG overview of tamoxifen trials, recurrence reductions of 21, 28 and 50%, respectively, after 1, 2 and 5 years of tamoxifen treatment were found in ER-positive breast cancer patients after about 10 years of follow-up. Moreover, adjuvant tamoxifen has an effect on the prevention of contralateral breast cancer (CBC): by the EBCTCG, reductions of 13, 26 and 47%, respectively, were found after 1, 2 and 5 years of tamoxifen treatment (Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, 1998). These reductions did not depend on dose. Some data suggest that primarily ER-positive CBCs were reduced. In contralateral breast tumours, more often a negative ER status (47% in tamoxifen users vs 12% in nonusers) was observed after tamoxifen treatment, but the numbers were very small (Rutqvist etal, 1991). A randomised prevention trial comparing tamoxifen (20 mg daily for 5 years) with placebo in healthy women at high risk for breast cancer showed a reduction in the incidence of invasive breast cancer of approximately 50% through 69 months of follow-up (Fisher etal, 1998). In the tamoxifen arm, the occurrence of ER-positive tumours was decreased by 69%, but no difference (38 vs 31 breast cancers) was seen in the occurrence of ER-negative tumours. The ER+/ER\xE2\x88\x92 ratio was 1.07 in tamoxifen users vs 4.19 in nonusers. The recent results of the IBIS I trial are consistent with these results; here also no difference in absolute numbers of ER-negative tumours was seen (19 vs 19 breast cancers) (IBIS Investigators, 2002).It is therefore suggested that the benefit of tamoxifen in breast cancer treatment and prevention results from the growth inhibition of occult ER-positive tumours, and that tamoxifen is unlikely to prevent the progression of ER-poor tumours, which is said to be associated with a less favourable prognosis (Fisher et al, 1998). In relation to this, and because of other events that influence morbidity, it has been speculated that the preventive effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer mortality in healthy women might be limited.We examined these issues by comparing the ER status of CBCs between two groups of postmenopausal patients with bilateral breast cancer, who had and had not received adjuvant tamoxifen for their initial breast cancer. In addition, we examined survival in tamoxifen-treated and nontreated patients after the diagnosis of CBC.METHODSFor this study, we identified all postmenopausal patients treated for a primary operable invasive breast cancer between 1984 and 1995, who were diagnosed with a CBC at least 1 year later. Patients from two cohorts were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis (NKI/AvL) in Amsterdam and from the Comprehensive Cancer Centre South (CCCS), which includes patients from eight community hospitals in the southeast of the Netherlands. Follow-up closed in December 1999.In the study period, approximately 2850 operable postmenopausal women (or 51 years of age and older) were treated for a first primary breast cancer in the NKI/AvL; 1071 received adjuvant tamoxifen. In the hospitals covered by the CCCS, 2923 postmenopausal patients (all stages) were treated in this period; 807 of them received tamoxifen.At the NKI/AvL, node-positive and node-negative breast cancer patients were randomised in an adjuvant tamoxifen trial to receive tamoxifen 30 mg day\xE2\x88\x921 for 1 or 3 years. ER status was not an eligibility criterion. The standard treatment in the CCCS region was adjuvant tamoxifen at a daily dose of 20\xE2\x80\x89mg. Initially, the use was restricted to patients with ER-positive tumours. In both cohorts, primary node-positive, ER-positive and ER-negative patients were increasingly treated with tamoxifen, 20\xE2\x80\x89mg day\xE2\x88\x921 from 1988 onwards. Treatment for the CBC was only local and no systemic treatment was administered.The follow-up scheme as advised by the ASCO was the same for the ipsi- as for the contralateral tumour (American Society of Clinical Oncology, 1997).In total, we identified 150 patients with metachronous CBC: 35 tamoxifen-treated patients and 115 patients without previous tamoxifen treatment. Excluded were patients with ipsilateral local recurrence or distant disease at diagnosis of the CBC, because the differential diagnosis between second primary tumour or metastasis in the breast would be difficult in those patients. Patients with a contralateral ductal in situ cancer were included in the analysis, but not patients with lobular in situ carcinoma.The data of the original ER reports (mostly analysis by biochemical methods) were used for the primary breast cancers. The paraffin blocks of the CBCs were requested from the different hospitals for immunohistochemical receptor analysis. Paraffin blocks of 30 patients of the treated group and 98 of the nonusers group were available for receptor analysis (staining with DAKO, clone 1D5, 1\xE2\x80\x89:\xE2\x80\x89500). The ER status was considered positive in cancers with more than 10% nuclear staining.Medical records were reviewed for clinical data: age, date of diagnosis, stage and ER status of both ipsi- and contralateral tumour, interval between ipsi- and contralateral tumor, tamoxifen treatment with dose and treatment duration and follow-up status up to December 1999.Statistical methodsFor 2 \xC3\x97 2 tables P-values were calculated from Fisher's exact test. The comparison between ipsi- and contralateral breast cancers was done by the test of McNemar.The triple association between tamoxifen treatment and ER status of first and second tumour was investigated by using binary repeated measurements analysis. Survival curves were calculated using the method of Kaplan and Meier and compared by the log-rank test. For overall survival the event of interest was death from any cause, and for disease-specific survival death from breast cancer.The statistical package SAS 6, 12 \xE2\x80\x93 specifically the procedures TTEST, FREQ, CATMOD, GLM, and LIFETEST \xE2\x80\x93 was used for all analyses.RESULTSAmong the 150 patients with CBC, 35 (23%) had been treated with adjuvant tamoxifen; 22 from the NKI and 13 from the CCCS. The mean age at first breast cancer was 62.4\xC2\xB17.4 (s.d.) years (range 51 \xE2\x80\x93 77), and the mean age at diagnosis of the CBC was 67.1\xC2\xB17.4 (s.d.) years (range 54\xE2\x80\x9379). The mean age at first breast cancer and CBC did not differ between the tamoxifen- and the nontreated group (

Of the 5773 patients treated in the two cohorts in the study period, 1878 (33%) received adjuvant tamoxifen. For the tamoxifen-treated patients, a crude CBC frequency of 1.9% was found and for the nonusers, a frequency of 3.0%.Since tamoxifen was prescribed to node-positive patients in particular, the stage of the primary breast tumour differed between both groups (\\n Table 1). The tumour stage of the second breast cancer (Table 2) also only slightly differed between the tamoxifen-treated and the nontreated patients, with proportions of pTis+pT1 tumours of 74 and 82%, respectively, (Fisher's exact test P=0.33). For nodal stage, a difference between the groups was found: the proportion with pN1 was 42% for the treated and 23% for the nontreated group (P=0.045). Overall, relatively more small tumours were found as compared to the first breast cancer, (McNemar's test P<0.0001).Tamoxifen users appear to have more often ER-negative second breast cancers than nonusers: 37 vs 18% (P=0.047). Among the patients not treated with tamoxifen, the proportions of ER-negative tumours were quite similar for the first and the contralateral breast tumour: 15 and 18%. In the tamoxifen-treated group, however, 10% of the first primary tumours were ER negative, and 37% of the contralateral tumours (McNemar's test P=0.016). Therefore, a binary repeated measurement analysis was done, indicating an increase in the proportion of ER-negative tumours between the first and the CBC in tamoxifen-treated patients compared to patients without previous tamoxifen treatment (P=0.012). This analysis was carried out on 88 of the patients for whom ER status was known for both tumours.The difference between the tamoxifen users and nonusers regarding ER negativity of the second breast cancer seems to be especially large Q1in the late (>5 years) CBC group (P=0.005). However, this differential effect of interval may still be because of chance (interval tamoxifen interaction: P=0.091 in exact logistic regression).Figure 1Figure 1Overall survival curve. and Figure 2Figure 2Disease-specific survival curve. show the overall and disease-specific survival curves from the time of diagnosis of the second breast cancer, according to tamoxifen use for the first breast cancer. Six-year overall survival for nontreated patients was 70 vs 69% for tamoxifen-treated patients (P=0.45), and disease-specific survival was 88 vs 78%, respectively (P=0.14). Adjustment for stage did not change these results (Figure 3Figure 3Stage-adjusted survival curve.).DISCUSSIONIn this analysis of ER status in CBC patients, we found a greater proportion of ER-negative second cancers in tamoxifen-treated patients than in patients without tamoxifen treatment. The stage of these ER-negative CBCs was more often node positive, but this result did not seem to have a major impact on survival after the diagnosis and treatment of contralateral disease. This finding is in agreement with Rutqvist et al (1991) who Q2reported 47% of ER-negative CBCs during and after tamoxifen use vs 12% in nonusers. In the recent report of Li et al (2001) also an increase was found in ER-negative CBCs after tamoxifen use: 26 vs 4% in nonusers. Rutqvist et al (1991) did not find differences in tumour size or nodal status in the CBCs of tamoxifen-treated and non treated patients. In the present study, the proportion of early-stage CBC (stage 0+1) was slightly, but not significantly (P=0.33), lower in the tamoxifen-treated group (74%) compared to the nontreated group (82%); if a difference at all, sensitivity of mammography (NKI/AvL data not shown) cannot explain this, because sensitivity was 87% in both groups.BRCA 1 gene mutation carriers have been reported to develop ER-negative tumours more often (Loman et al, 1998). In the present study, no identified carriers were present among the tamoxifen users. Only one of three ER-negative patients of the tamoxifen-users group had a weak positive family history. In the nonusers group, two patients were known BRCA 1 mutation carriers; both had negative ER of first and second breast cancer. Thus the greater proportion of second ER-negative breast cancers cannot be explained by a difference in family history.Radmacher et al (2000) found more ER-negative tumours in the second and third year of the tamoxifen treatment. And Rutqvist et al (1991) found slightly more ER-negative tumours during tamoxifen treatment or within 3 months after cessation. In the present study, a significant time dependency for ER-negative tumours was not established, but a trend for more ER-negative CBCs was seen 5 years or more since the start of the tamoxifen treatment. This is somewhat paradoxical, assuming that ER-positive tumours, occult at diagnosis of the first breast cancer, are treated by tamoxifen, whereas the ER-negative tumours can grow. In the first 5 years after diagnosis of the first breast cancer, in both treatment groups 21% of ER-negative tumours is seen. But after these 5 years, a difference becomes apparent: of the CBCs in the nonusers, only 10% has a negative ER, whereas 44% of the CBCs in tamoxifen users has a negative ER. This could mean that tamoxifen not only cures but also prevents ER-positive CBCs. This apparent selection of ER-negative breast cancer after tamoxifen use is more surprising as Tarone etal (2002) established that the increase in the incidence of breast cancer after 50 years of age is largely because of an increase in ER-positive breast cancers, while the incidence of ER-negative cancers remains constant.No literature could be found with regard to molecular \xE2\x80\x93 biological mechanisms of second primary breast cancers after adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. A review of O'Regan and Jordan (2002) describes the known mechanisms of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) at a target site, but the proportions of ER coregulator proteins and the pathways have not yet been established. The SERM \xE2\x80\x93 ER complex can recruit coactivators and corepressors, and these complexes may modulate genes by different pathways.In the present analysis, 6-year overall survival after diagnosis of CBC was not different in tamoxifen users and nonusers. A difference in disease-specific survival at 6 years, 88% in nonusers vs 78% in tamoxifen users, did not reach statistical significance. Nor was the 6-year overall survival different for both groups after adjustment for the stage of the first tumour. A limitation of these analyses is, however, that the treated and nontreated groups were not totally comparable regarding other tumour characteristics.In conclusion, the presented results suggest that the CBCs developing after 1\xE2\x80\x933 years of use of adjuvant tamoxifen are more frequently ER negative, and node positive. This observation, however, does not seem to have a major impact on the overall survival.\",\"id\":\"875b8b7b-54a6-495c-b96c-a676cab61857\",\"_version_\":1534949305211682816},{\"nlmTa\":\"Case Rep Ophthalmol\",\"all\":[\"Case Rep Ophthalmol\",\"Case Rep Ophthalmol\",\"Case Reports in Ophthalmology\",\"2014-12-10\",\"S.

Ocular complications of tamoxifen are rare and include vortex keratopathy, bilateral crystalline maculopathy, macular edema and optic neuritis [1, 2, 3, 4]. We report a patient who developed bilateral macular edema without crystalline deposits while receiving tamoxifen. Maculopathy secondary to tamoxifen therapy was considered.Case ReportA 41-year-old female patient was referred to our department for progressive bilateral visual loss over the last 2 months. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had undergone a radical mastectomy 6 years ago. Since then, she had been receiving tamoxifen at a dosage of 20 mg/day.On examination, the Snellen best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in her right eye (OD) was 3/10 and that in her left eye (OS) was 2/10. Intraocular pressure was normal and anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed severe bilateral macular edema. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed bilateral, intraretinal macular edema with a central macular thickness of 506 \xCE\xBCm in her OD and of 469 \xCE\xBCm in her OS, respectively (fig. 1). Fluorescein angiography showed late-phase diffuse hyperfluorescence corresponding to the edematous area in both eyes (fig. 2). A diagnosis of central serous retinopathy was excluded because fluorescein angiography revealed no leakage point from the choroid in early phases. Furthermore, no pigment epithelium detachment was detected.Due to a history of tamoxifen administration for 6 years and absence of other pathologies causing macular edema, maculopathy secondary to tamoxifen therapy was considered. Tamoxifen therapy was discontinued. Instead of tamoxifen, the patient was administered 1 mg anastrozole daily which is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. The patient received 250 mg of acetazolamide three times a day and nepafenac drops three times a day to both eyes for a period of 1 month.Shortly after this, the central macular thickness started to diminish with both foveae regaining their normal contour within 2 months (fig. 3). Subsequently, her vision was restored to 10/10 BCVA 3 months later.DiscussionTamoxifen-induced retinopathy is a rare complication. The incidence among patients receiving tamoxifen is 0.6% and can increase up to 10.9% with the use of chemotherapy. The first case of tamoxifen-induced retinopathy was first described by Kaiser-Kupfer and Lippman in 1978 (it was about a woman who received extremely high doses of tamoxifen due to metastatic breast cancer) [1]. Since then, a number of studies have suggested that the use of low doses (20\xE2\x80\x9340 mg/day) may be associated with a decrease in visual acuity and tamoxifen-induced retinopathy.There are two types of tamoxifen-induced retinopathy. One of them is an acute form, which manifests as diminished vision, retinal edema, retinal hemorrhage and optic disk swelling. This form may be due to the estrogenic activity of tamoxifen and is reversible after the discontinuation of the drug [5]. Selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen interact with two kinds of estrogenic receptors (ERs) referred to as \xCE\xB1 and \xCE\xB2. The ratio of ER\xCE\xB1 and ER\xCE\xB2 to a tissue is associated with the function of selective estrogen receptor modulators as estrogenic or antiestrogenic [6].After a long-term use of the drug, typical tamoxifen-induced retinopathy is characterized by the presence of crystalline maculopathy, which consists of refractive intraretinal crystalline deposits, especially in the perifoveal area that histologically may represent the products of axonal degeneration [2]. This damage might explain the associated visual loss caused by this type of retinopathy that may not reverse when tamoxifen is discontinued. Tamoxifen maculopathy is also often associated with macular edema, which is an accumulation of intraretinal fluid that subsequently decreases visual acuity.More recent studies with 3D-OCT reveal intraretinal cysts, even in patients with no visual symptoms and normal fundoscopy. Therefore 3D-OCT screening is recommended for all patients treated with tamoxifen [3, 4, 7, 8].In our case, discontinuation of the drug improved vision. We also administer oral acetazolamide and nepafenac eyedrops. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors increase fluid transport across the retinal pigment epithelium by inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. They are effective in cystoid macular edema and may also be effective in other types of macular edema. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as nepafenac inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is required for the production of the prostaglandins and may be beneficial in managing retinal edema [9].In our case, there were severe bilateral intraretinal edemas documented by OCT without the presence of crystalline retinopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported, where bilateral intraretinal macular edema is the only retinal manifestation in a patient on oral tamoxifen.ConclusionBilateral macular edema can be a manifestation of tamoxifen-induced retinopathy without the presence of typical crystalline deposits. Patients under tamoxifen treatment must periodically be examined by ophthalmologists for the early detection of tamoxifen-induced retinopathy and discontinuation of tamoxifen treatment if needed.Disclosure StatementThe authors have not received grant support or research funding, and they do not have any proprietary interests in the material described in the article.\",\"id\":\"d537353e-6afa-4361-a109-debda0c723c1\",\"_version_\":1534950616526225409},{\"nlmTa\":\"World J Surg Oncol\",\"all\":[\"World J Surg Oncol\",\"World Journal of Surgical Oncology\",\"2010-8-12\",\"BioMed Central\",\"\",\"20704728\",\"2928230\",\"Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary and antecedent of adjuvant tamoxifen use for breast cancer\",\"8\",\"67\",\"67\"],\"journalTitle\":\"World Journal of Surgical Oncology\",\"epub\":\"2010-8-12\",\"publisherName\":\"BioMed Central\",\"publisherLoc\":\"\",\"pmid\":20704728,\"pmc\":2928230,\"articleTitle\":\"Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary and antecedent of adjuvant tamoxifen use for breast cancer\",\"volume\":8,\"fpage\":67,\"lpage\":67,\"body\":\"BackgroundGranulosa cell tumor is a relatively uncommon ovarian neoplasm accounting for 1% to 2% of all ovarian tumors[1]. Tamoxifen is a non steroidal triphenylethylene that competitively antagonizes the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma[2-5]. The occurrence of granulosa cell tumors in patients with antecedent tamoxifen has been previously reported in two patients[6,7]. Although tamoxifen has anti-estrogenic properties, it is converted to several metabolites that can act as estrogen agonists [6]. We report the third case of granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with tamoxifen use for breast carcinoma.Case presentationA 47-year-old gravidia 3, para 3 women with chemotherapy induced menopause, had been diagnosed with stage III(T2 N2M0) infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast 5 years before the development of a bilateral granulosa cell tumor of the ovary. After Patey's mastectomy, patient has received 6 cycle of anthracycline based chemotherapy (AC 60 protocol: adriamycin at 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide at 600 mg/m2) and adjuvant radiotherapy at a cumulative dose of 50 Gy. The estrogen receptors were strongly positive and the patient received tamoxifen at a dose of 20 mg as single daily dose since January 2004. The tamoxifen was stopped after 5 years. In February 2009, one month after that the patient has stopped the tamoxifen therapy, a nodule in the left ovary was discovered during a laparoscopy for tubal ligation. A left oopherectomy was done, the pathological results showed a granulosa cell tumor. Following this a total hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, pelvic and peritoneal washings and multiple peritoneal biopsies were done. The histopathological analysis showed a granulosa cell tumor of the right ovary with capsular rupture in the left ovary, moderate nuclear atypia and mitotic activity ranged between 3 and 5 per ten high-power-fields. Histological evaluation of uterus showed a proliferative endometrial lining. The tumor was classified as stage Ic according to the FIGO classification. The case of our patient was discussed in the multidisciplinary meeting and it was decided to keep her on a close follow-up. Thirteen months after initial diagnosis of granulosa cell of the ovary, she is free of disease.DiscussionThe granulosa cell tumor is a relatively uncommon ovarian neoplasm accounting 1% to 2% of all ovarian tumors [1]. These lesions occur most frequently in menopausal or postmenopausal women and may be associated with symptoms of estrogen or progesterone secretion [1]. The relationship between this hormonal treatment and the occurrence of such an ovarian tumor is questionable, as so many patients worldwide receive tamoxifen therapy and only two previous cases has been reported in literature till date. It's probable that the association of granulosa cell tumor and the use of tamoxifen for breast cancer is just a random observation and there is no relationship between them.As mentioned earlier, the granulosa cell tumors in conjunction with tamoxifen administration for breast cancer have been reported in literature. The first case was reported in 1994 by Gherman et al [6] in a 52-year-old woman. This patient had liver dysfunction induced by tamoxifen. The 
2016-05-22T09:35:34.100602+00:00 app[web.1]: authors suggested that the impaired hepatic metabolism of the tamoxifen may be responsible for the ovarian tumor in their patient with elevated liver transaminase levels. The second case was reported in 2002 by Arnould et al [7]; they described a case of metastases of a breast carcinoma to an adult granulosa cell tumor in a 63-year-old woman receiving tamoxifen therapy with a past history of breast carcinoma. No explanation was provided for the occurrence and that was only the second case in the literature despite that the tamoxifen being used by a large number of patients around the world with breast cancer. Tamoxifen is an anti-oestrogenic non-steroidal compound widely used for adjuvant therapy in breast cancer [8]. Its proven efficacy as a chemotherapeutic agent has led to its prophylactic use in the prevention of breast cancer in healthy women at high risk of developing breast cancer and it has also shown efficacy in this regard [9]. Despite these anticarcinogenic properties, tamoxifen is also a carcinogen. Women, who take tamoxifen, whether therapeutically or prophylactically, are at significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer [9-11]. Tamoxifen is also a potent liver carcinogen in male and female rats [12], and induces uterine tumors when administered to neonatal [13] and adult rats [14,15]. These findings suggest an appropriate surveillance of these patients treated with tamoxifen in order to proceed to an early diagnosis of secondary gynecological cancers.Tamoxifen is subject to extensive hepatic metabolism. Not surprisingly, several of the metabolites are predominately estrogenic, rather than antiestrogenic. Differences in tamoxifen metabolism among mice, rats, and humans probably contribute to variation among species-agonist versus partial agonist properties [16].The metabolite E is generated by the catabolism of tamoxifen, which has a lower affinity for estrogen receptors than tamoxifen [17-19]. However the cis isomer of metabolite E (tamoxifen with a hydroxyl group in place of the dimethylaminoethane side chain) is a potent agonist that displays a high affinity for the estrogen receptor [5,20]. This metabolite has been isolated from dog bile, a species where tamoxifen is predominantly estrogenic. Wiebe et al have identified metabolite E and bisphenol in tamoxifen resistant MCF-7 human breast tumors implanted in athymic nude mice, as well as in tumors isolated from patients who have undergone unsuccessful tamoxifen therapy [21,22]. Tamoxifen is known to exhibit estrogenic effects in other animal species. Tucker et al were showed in the studies of tamoxifen oncogenicity an elevated of the incidence of granulosa cell tumors at 36% in two groups of female mice receiving 5 or 50 mg/kg of tamoxifen [23]. In their study on cultured rat granulosa cells, welsh et al proved that tamoxifen exerts an augmentative, dose-dependent estrogenic effect on FSH-stimulated aromatase activity and estrogen production. They demonstrated that tamoxifen compete with [3H] estradiol for binding to the ovarian estrogen receptors [24].Raloxifene and tamoxifen are Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) that have estrogen agonist activities on bone and serum lipid metabolism, and estrogen antagonist activities in mammary tissue in ovariectomized rats [25-27]. Treatment with raloxifene for 6 months resulted in disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, manifested by increased plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol-17b (E2), and failure of ovulation. Many (56% to 80%) rats in all raloxifene treated groups had focal, minimal to slight hyperplasia of granulosa cells within individual retained follicles. A few treated rats in the mid- and high-dose groups had more extensive focal proliferation of granulosa cells. The results of this study indicate that raloxifene administration to rats causes increases in granulosa cell hyperplasia [25].ConclusionsAssociation between granulosa cell of the ovary and antecedent use of tamoxifen is very rare. When compared to world wide tamoxifen use among women, it appears to be just a random appearance and tamoxifen use does not appear to increase the risk of granulosa cell tumor of the ovary.ConsentWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

On the other hand, an undesirable side effect of increasing risk of endometrial cancer has been suspected for decades 2-6. A number of case-control studies showed that the risk of endometrial cancer increased after long-term tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer patients 2-6. A vast majority of these case-control studies were conducted in the western world with a small sample size (from a total of a few hundred to a few thousand cases in each study 2-6. The data of tamoxifen use from Asia countries were scarce. A previous study of 674 consecutive breast patients in Japan reported that tamoxifen use for longer than 5 years correlated with increasing risk of developing endometrial cancer, while the small sample size prevented to detect statistical significance 7.A more recent study analyzing pooled studies from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and National Library of Medicine for published data from January 1970 to December 2010, however, reported that \xE2\x80\x9CThe risk of endometrial cancer, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is low in women <50 years who take tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention. The risk decreases from the active to follow-up phase of treatment 8. In addition, although levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) has been used in patients with breast patients taking tamoxifen (TAM) to prevent endometrial proliferation, the benefits, the side effects, and the patients suitable for this treatment are still elusive 9.The above facts clearly indicate the needs for further clarification of the potential link between Tamoxifen use and the risk for endometrial cancer. Since the incidences of breast and endometrial cancer have been increasing (Figure 1), according to the Taiwan cancer registration system (https://cris.bhp.doh.gov.tw/pagepub/Home.aspx), our study aimed to assess the endometrial cancer risk after tamoxifen adjuvant treatment for female breast cancer patients in Taiwan using a significantly large and population-based database.Materials and MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate tamoxifen use on endometrial cancer risk for breast cancer patients in Taiwan. In our study, the data included details of inpatient orders files, inpatient expenditures by admissions files, details of ambulatory care orders files and ambulatory care expenditures files. The above data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (http://www.nhri.org.tw/nhird/en/index.htm) provided by the Bureau of National Health Insurance, Department of Health, and managed by National Health Research Institutes. All identifiers of all patients were completely removed before the release of the documentation and the encrypted data used in our study cannot link to any of the specific individual.A total of 74,280 patients treated for breast cancer between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2004 were included in the study. The cases were identified according to the coding of Ninth Revision International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) 1740-1749 (malignant neoplasm of female breast). Of the 74,280 patients, 39,411 (53.1%) received tamoxifen treatment, and 34,869 (46.9 %) did not. The duration of tamoxifen treatment was timed from the first to the last prescription for tamoxifen. Tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer was defined as endometrial cancer that occurred in patients at least 6-month after the diagnosis of breast cancer, who underwent tamoxifen treatment.Descriptive statistics were used for patients' demographic characteristics analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the potential association between the development of endometrial cancer with tamoxifene treatment, prior hormone exposure, hypertension, diabetes and age. The SAS statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC. Version 9.1) was used to perform analysis. The statistical significance was adopted at p values of less than 0.05.ResultsA total of 222 patients developed endometrial cancer. The characteristics of these 222 patients are shown in Table 1. Of the 222 endometrial cancer cases
2016-05-22T09:35:34.100602+00:00 app[web.1]: , 153 (69 %) were seen in patients with tamoxifen treatment, and 69 (31%) were seen in patients without the use of tamoxifen. The incidence of endometrial cancer was 0.388% (153/39,411) in patients with tamoxifen treatment, while was 0.198% (69/34,869) in patients without tamoxifen treatment (p < 0.001).Among patients with tamoxifen treatment, the average duration of tamoxifen use was 2.91 years in patients developed endometrial cancer, and was 1.67 years in patients did not develop endometrial cancer (Table 2).Logistic regression of endometrial cancer risk for breast cancer patients on prior hormone exposure, hypertension, diabetes, age and tamoxifene treatment are shown in Table 3. Tamoxifen use and age over 35 years were significantly correlated with the development of endometrial cancer (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). Patients treated with tamoxifen had a significantly higher risk of endometrial cancer than those who did not take tamoxifen (OR 1.86; 95%CI, 1.40-2.47; p < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in prior hormone exposure, hypertension and diabetes.Logistic regression of endometrial cancer risk for breast cancer patients with tamoxifen use on duration of tamoxifen treatment, prior hormone exposure, hypertension, diabetes and age are shown in Table 4. A link between long-term tamoxifen use and increasing endometrial cancer risk by odds ratio was 2.94 (95%CI, 2.13-4.06) for 3 years or longer; the odds ratio was 4.08 (95%CI, 1.67-9.93) for women aged older than 35 years compared to those aged 35 or younger than 35 years for breast cancer patients with tamoxifen use. There were no significant differences in prior hormone exposure, hypertension and diabetes.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest population based study to further assess the potential association between tamoxifen use for breast cancer treatment and the risk for endometrial cancer. Our study reveals that tamoxifen use and age over 35 years were significantly correlated with the development of endometrial cancer for breast cancer patients. Furthermore, for breast cancer patients undergoing tamoxifen treatment, a link between long-term tamoxifen use and increasing endometrial cancer risk by odds ratio was 2.94 (95%CI, 2.13-4.06) for 3 years or longer; the odds ratio was 4.08 (95%CI, 1.67-9.93) for women aged older than 35 years compared to those aged 35 or younger than 35 years. There were no significant differences in prior hormone exposure, hypertension and diabetes.Our findings are largely in line with those of previous studies. A case-control study revealed a significantly increasing endometrial cancer risk by OR 3.6 (95% CI; 2.6 to 4.8) for breast cancer women with tamoxifen treatment beyond five years compared those women with no treatment 4. The Comprehensive Cancer Centres' ALERT Group detected an increasing endometrial cancer risk for longer duration of tamoxifen use, relative risk 6.9 (95%CI, 2.4-19.4) for at least 5 years and 2.0 (95%CI, 1.2-3.2) for 2-5 years compared with non-users in breast cancer women 6.Our study has also obtained several unique findings that are not sufficiently addressed in previous studies, such the duration of tamoxifen use and patients' age. Previous studies showed an increasing endometrial cancer risk after 5-year tamoxifen use 4, 6, while our study reveals the risk impact can occur fewer than 3-years. Our study has suggested that age is an important factor for the development of endometrial cancer in breast cancer patients. In our study, an increasing endometrial cancer risk by OR 4.16 (95% CI = 1.71 to 10.14) was observed in the breast cancer women aged older than 35 years compared with the younger breast cancer patients (Table 3). Our study has also detected an increasing endometrial cancer risk by OR 4.08 (95% CI = 1.67 to 9.93) in breast cancer patients with tamoxifen treatment for women older than 35 years compared with the younger ones (Table 4).It is very important to prevent endometrial cancer developing or diagnose at early stage as tamoxifen is commonly used for all stages of hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients. A previous study reported that the endometrium thickness cumulatively increased during the tamoxifen treatment and the thicker endometrium remained years after the end of treatment, which results in increasing endometrial cancer development 10. Another study showed that breast cancer patients with tamoxifen use have early stage endometrial cancer and good prognoses 11. The incidence of subsequent endometrial carcinoma does not increase for primary breast cancer patients with tamoxifen usage if the patients underwent annual screening for gynecologic malignancies, including a pelvic examination, cervix and endometrium examination 12. Regular follow-up of the endometrium thickness in breast cancer women taking tamoxifen may play an important role for endometrial carcinoma early diagnosis 10.The risk of endometrial cancer has been traditionally reported for postmenopausal women receiving long term tamoxifen therapy. However, more than half of patients in this study appear to have developed cancer within 3 years, almost a third within 18 months. It was different from the western countries. The incidence peak of Taiwanese female breast cancer is also different form the western countries 13. The clinical implications need more studies for evaluating the pathogenesis, environmental genetics and other factors.ConclusionsOur study shows that tamoxifen use and age over 35 years significantly correlated with breast cancer patients with endometrial cancer. An increased awareness among gynecologic health provider may help early diagnose endometrial cancer. Regular gynecologic follow-up may be mandatory for those women with three years or above of tamoxifen use and age over 35 years.\",\"id\":\"3d5c9895-5e00-4e80-8250-528414a07b19\",\"_version_\":1534951906565160960},{\"nlmTa\":\"Oncol Lett\",\"all\":[\"Oncol Lett\",\"Oncol Lett\",\"Oncology Letters\",\"2014-9\",\"2014-7-04\",\"D.A.

The goal of this type of therapy is to counteract the production and the action of estrogens. The ovary is the primary site of estrogen production in premenopausal women, whereas, in postmenopausal women, the main source of estrogens is adipose tissue. Therefore, ovarian function suppression [by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists] is an effective adjuvant strategy in premenopausal women with EDBC. Similarly, the inhibition of estrogen action at the receptor site by tamoxifen has proven to be effective (1).To date, international consensus statements recommend tamoxifen (20 mg/day) for five years as the standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women, while the role of LHRH agonists remains controversial and under active investigation (2\xE2\x80\x934). In particular, the value of the addition of ovarian suppression by LHRH agonists along with tamoxifen, particularly in chemotherapy-treated patients who may develop ovarian failure as a consequence of cytotoxic treatment, is not well-defined (2,4\xE2\x80\x937).It should be noted that tamoxifen is a potent inducer of ovarian function in premenopausal women (8). The evaluation of endocrine parameters in premenopausal women during treatment with tamoxifen as a single agent has demonstrated that the levels of estradiol, estrone and progesterone are elevated one- to three-fold (9). Therefore, the effect of numerous years of ovarian stimulation by tamoxifen must be evaluated, particularly in women with node-negative disease or in healthy women in whom tamoxifen is used to prevent breast cancer. Equally important is the effect that the hyperestrogenism induced by tamoxifen exerts at the endometrial level (10,11).In the present study, we report two cases of ovarian cyst formation and endometrial hyperplasia induced by tamoxifen used alone as adjuvant treatment for estrogen positive breast cancer in premenopausal women. This study demonstrated the requirement for the administration of LHRH agonist to effectively suppress the tamoxifen-induced estrogen hyperproduction by the ovaries. Patients provided written informed consent.Case reportsCase 1In January 2013, a 37-year-old woman was admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Sirai Hospital (Carbonia, Italy) with a diagnosis of bilateral ovarian cysts associated with endometrial hyperplasia and lower abdominal pain, with suspected ovarian malignancy. The patient reported amenorrhea and was willing to have a pregnancy.Two years previously, the patient had undergone conservative breast surgery for high-grade ductal carcinoma of the right breast [stage I; estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, 90%; progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive; 80%; human epidermal growth factor 2-negative; Ki67 labeling index, 10%]. Following surgery, the patient received breast irradiation and adjuvant tamoxifen therapy without an LHRH agonist. There was no history of ovarian enlargement prior to tamoxifen administration.During the periodic oncological follow-up examinations, a transvaginal sonogram demonstrated endometrial hyperplasia with a hyperechogenic
2016-05-22T09:35:34.100602+00:00 app[web.1]:  heterogeneous endometrial pattern with a thickness of 15.5 mm (Fig. 1). Bilateral ovarian cysts were also observed, including a right multilocular ovarian cyst (85\xC3\x9740 mm) and a left multiloculated mass (65\xC3\x9746 mm). Color Doppler sonography showed partially vascularized intracystic septa (Fig. 2). No evidence of ascites was observed and tumor markers, cancer antigen (CA)-125, CA-15.3 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), were within the normal range.As the patient was undergoing tamoxifen treatment without ovarian suppression with a LHRH agonist, we hypothesized that ovarian hyperstimulation was present. Subsequently, the levels of serum estradiol were measured and identified to be 1,200 pg/ml. The patient was symptomatic with lower abdominal pain and, thus, laparoscopic bilateral ovarian cystectomy was performed. The extemporaneous histological examination revealed bilateral follicular ovarian cysts. A hysteroscopy with biopsy was also performed, and the histological examination showed a \xE2\x80\x98simplex endometrial hyperplasia\xE2\x80\x99. The postoperative course was without complications, and the patient was discharged two days later.Continuation of tamoxifen therapy plus the addition of an LHRH agonist was discussed with the patient, and the patient accepted. The pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound (US) examination three months later showed a regression of the endometrial hyperplasia (thickness, 7.6 mm). The patient has continued the adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen and an LHRH agonist, and the follow-up examinations of one year to February 2014 have been negative for breast cancer relapse. Transvaginal US evaluation over one year after surgery showed an endometrial thickness in the normal range (<8 mm), normal ovaries (left ovary, 33\xC3\x9717 mm in the largest sagittal diameter; right ovary, 24\xC3\x9710 mm in the perpendicular diameter) and estradiol levels (<20.00 pg/ml).Case 2In June 2013, a 33-year-old woman was admitted to the Department of Gynaecologic Oncology, A. Businco Hospital (Cagliari, Italy) with a diagnosis of left ovarian cysts and endometrial hyperplasia. Two years previously, the patient underwent radical mastectomy plus ipsilateral lymphadenectomy for a low grade papillary carcinoma of the right breast (stage I; ER-positive, 80%, PgR-positive, 80%; HER2-negative, Ki67 labeling index, 15%). Following surgery, adjuvant endocrine treatment with tamoxifen and an LHRH agonist was initiated.After 10 months, the patient chose to terminate the LHRH agonist treatment for self-reported side effects consisting of insomnia, irritability and arthralgia. The patient continued to receive 20 mg/day of tamoxifen alone. At the 12th month following LHRH interruption, during the planned periodic examinations, a transvaginal US showed a heterogeneous endometrial pattern (thickness, 14 mm) and the presence of a multilocular left ovarian cyst (54\xC3\x9744\xC3\x9740 mm). Color duplex sonography showed no increased vascularization. No evidence of ascites was observed and laboratory data indicated an elevated serum estradiol concentration of 698.80 pg/ml. Tumor markers (CA-125, CA-15.3 and CEA) were within the normal range.Continuation of tamoxifen therapy and the resumption of a LHRH analog were discussed with the patient, and the patient accepted. The pelvic and transvaginal US examination three months later showed an endometrial hyperechogenic pattern with a thickness of 7.6 mm, and normal ovaries (left, 20\xC3\x9715.9 mm in the largest sagittal diameter; right, 21\xC3\x9716 mm in the perpendicular diameter). The patient\xE2\x80\x99s estradiol levels decreased to 22.14 pg/ml. The next follow-up assessments to February 2014 showed normal endometrial thickness, ovaries and estradiol levels; in addition, examinations for breast cancer recurrence were negative.DiscussionThe cases described in the present report demonstrated the presence of functional ovarian cysts with very high estrogen levels during the administration of tamoxifen alone as an adjuvant treatment for premenopausal EDBC. The patients also presented with biopsy-proven endometrial hyperplasia.A limited number of studies have reported cases of tamoxifen-induced ovarian cysts in breast cancer patients (8,12\xE2\x80\x9317). These papers show that tamoxifen-induced ovarian cysts commonly occur after three months of tamoxifen treatment, with the highest incidence in the interval between three to 11 months after treatment initiation. Additionally, the development of ovarian cysts after two years of tamoxifen treatment is extremely rare.Tamoxifen therapy for five years is considered the standard endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with EDBC (18). However, data on the impact of tamoxifen on ovarian function are often lacking in the literature. As the ovary is the main source of estrogen in premenopausal women, the evaluation of ovarian function during tamoxifen treatment should represent a central issue in the management of EDBC in premenopausal women. It has been reported that during tamoxifen treatment, a percentage of premenopausal patients have increased ovarian function associated with elevated estradiol levels. In these patients, the amenorrhea, if present, may falsely suggest ovarian failure, masking the presence of hyperactive ovaries (19).Tamoxifen may increase plasma estrogen concentrations by interfering with normal negative pituitary feedback mechanisms, with a resulting increase in follicle-stimulating hormone-driven ovarian steroidogenesis (12). Subsequently, the development of ovarian cysts associated with high estradiol levels indicates the presence of hyperactive ovaries as a consequence of tamoxifen action. An additional mechanism involved in the increased estrogen production by tamoxifen is its direct effect on granulosa cells (20).It is still currently debated whether the ovarian stimulation induced by tamoxifen could theoretically interfere with its antitumoral effects in premenopausal EDBC. In this context, a high-priority research question is whether additional benefit is gained with the use of LHRH agonists in addition to tamoxifen or as an alternative (21). Two meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials assessing the role of LHRH agonists in the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal EDBC patients (22,23) demonstrated a clear benefit in terms of recurrence rate and disease-free survival from ovarian suppression with LHRH agonists, both in combination with tamoxifen and as a single intervention. Notably, when assessing the subgroup of patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy that is expected to induce a menopausal status, a significant benefit in terms of reduced recurrence rate and death has been observed only in very young premenopausal women (aged \xE2\x89\xA440 years) (23). It is hypothesized that chemotherapy is less likely to induce permanent amenorrhea in this population of patients than in older women. This evidence may be even more significant in women receiving more modern based chemotherapy regimens, which induce less commonly permanent amenorrhea (24), and even more significant in premenopausal patients who are not candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy. In this context, noteworthy data have been presented by Mourits et al (8), who showed that in patients who remained premenopausal after standard dose chemotherapy, tamoxifen use was associated, despite amenorrhea, with the development of ovarian cysts associated with the high estradiol levels that were indicative of overactive ovaries.The findings of the present study suggested that, in addition to the concerns regarding the optimum endocrine adjuvant treatment for premenopausal breast cancer, the effect of tamoxifen on the endometrium should be carefully considered. Ovarian hyperstimulation, with increasing circulating estrogens, induced by tamoxifen in premenopausal patients, may significantly influence the occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia and the subsequent risk of endometrial cancer. Additionally, the direct proliferative effect of tamoxifen on the endometrium should be considered (11,25).Thus, in young premenopausal patients with estrogen-dependent breast cancer, ovarian suppression is an essential prerequisite for an adjuvant endocrine with tamoxifen. In this context, LHRH agonist treatment by suppressing effective ovarian function may lead to a hypoestrogenic status that may positively impact breast cancer prognosis (23) and prevent the effects of tamoxifen at the gynecological level (endometrial hyperplasia and ovarian cyst formation) (26). In the literature, the majority of reported tamoxifen-induced ovarian cysts disappeared following cessation of tamoxifen treatment (13). In addition, cotreatment with tamoxifen and an LHRH agonist resolved ovarian cysts (14\xE2\x80\x9317). By contrast, expectant management without abandoning tamoxifen use may cause complications, such as torsion and cystic necrosis; in these latter cases, even if the ovarian enlargement is benign, the growth of cysts may require surgical intervention with an increased risk of morbidity.In conclusion, based on this evidence, it is important to reconsider the action of tamoxifen on ovarian function, and include these specific effects of tamoxifen on ovarian activity in the informed consent of premenopausal patients who are candidates for tamoxifen alone as adjuvant endocrine treatment.\",\"id\":\"60633f5c-9a69-476d-ad46-4500ec5f66d3\",\"_version_\":1534952024766939136}]}}\n"

Studies have demonstrated key differences in spontaneous BRCA-associated tumors [2,3]. BRCA1 cancers are more likely to show a basal phenotype, with 80% to 90% of BRCA1 cancers being negative for ER and HER2 and positive for basal cytokeratins [4,5]. BRCA1 cancers also have characteristic gene-expression and genomic profiles, and appear to be sensitive to DNA damage by cisplatinum. Although reports suggest that lobular carcinomas may be more frequent in BRCA2 carriers, no specific molecular phenotype has been described for BRCA2-associated tumors, which usually show a ductal, no-special-type morphology and ER positivity [6].RAD21 is a component of the multiprotein complex cohesin, which is involved in maintaining alignment and cohesion of replicated \\\"sister\\\" chromatids. RAD21, together with SMC1, SMC3, and STAG1/2, forms a tripartite ring, which according to the \\\"ring model,\\\" promotes sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) by encircling sister chromatids [7]. SCC not only is vital for correct chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis, but also plays an important role in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). By promoting sister-chromatid alignment, cohesin allows BRCA1/2-mediated homologous recombination to occur between sister chromatids [8]. In addition to its role in maintaining sister-chromatid cohesion, evidence now suggests cohesins are involved in promoting and inhibiting gene transcription. In MCF-7 cell lines, genes cobound by cohesin and ER are preferentially regulated by estrogen [9]. Cohesin may also act as a negative regulator of gene expression, by physically blocking enhancer/promoter interaction [10].Of the four proteins that compose the core cohesin complex, RAD21 has emerged as a key marker of tumor behavior. A meta-analysis of gene-expression data from clinical cancer specimens showed that increased RAD21 expression was a feature of poorly differentiated breast, ovarian, bladder, and lung cancers [11]. Gene-expression profiling of 31 breast cancer patients with supraclavicular lymph node metastasis revealed RAD21 as one of six genes that were differentially expressed between good- and poor-outcome groups [12]. Our previous study on sporadic breast cancers showed that RAD21 overexpression correlated with early relapse in high-grade breast cancers regardless of intrinsic tumor subtype [13]. We, and others, also showed that RAD21 knockdown confers in vitro resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents, which recapitulated the findings in our cohort of sporadic breast cancers [13,14].Although RAD21 overexpression correlates with early relapse and treatment resistance in sporadic cancers, it is unclear whether familial breast cancers behave in a similar manner. This may be of particular relevance, as RAD21, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are all involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination; hence RAD21 overexpression in the absence of either BRCA1 or -2 may not necessarily confer the same predictive and prognostic implications as in sporadic cancers with intact BRCA1/2. We therefore performed an immunohistochemical analysis of RAD21 expression in a cohort of familial breast cancers. We also postulated that enhanced RAD21 expression may be associated with changes in both DNA copy number and reduced expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), and therefore correlated RAD21 expression with genomic changes and miRNAs predicted to target RAD21.Materials and methodsPatientsBreast cancer specimens were collected from a previously characterized cohort of 139 female patients from the kConFab family breast cancer registry (Table 1) [15]. Classification of BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX status was performed as described previously [15]. The flow of patients according to the REMARK guidelines (Additional file 1 Table S1) [16]. Of the 139 cases, 18 cases were excluded because of the lack of tissue available for array construction, and a further 27 cases were excluded because of the absence of tumor on the array stained for RAD21. The final cohort was composed of 94 cases, which included 28 BRCA1, 27 BRCA2, and 39 BRCAX cases. This study has ethics committee approval (Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 09/36). Consent to participate in the study and consent to publish were obtained by kConFab in accordance with its family-enrollment and data-collection guidelines [17]. Patients were followed up for a median period of 64.0 months (range, 0.4 to 299.0 months). During this time, 38 patients relapsed, and 33 died of breast cancer (deaths unrelated to breast cancer were censored). Relapse-free survival was defined as the time to first reappearance of tumor at any site after definitive treatment, whereas breast cancer-specific survival was defined as time from primary surgical excision to breast cancer-related death. All patients with HER2-positive tumors were diagnosed prior to 2000, and did not receive trastuzumab therapy.Table 1Clinical and tumor characteristicsBRCA1 n (%)BRCA2n (%)BRCAX n (%)All familialn (%)Age\xE2\x89\xA4 50 years25 (89%)15 (56%)24 (61%)64 (68%)> 50 years3 (11%)12 (44%)15 (39%)30 (32%)Tumor size< 20 mm20 (71%)13 (52%)16 (47%)49 (56%)> 20 mm8 (29%)12 (48%)18 (53%)38 (44%)Unknown0257Nodal statusNegative26 (93%)19 (70%)25 (64%)70 (74%)Positive2 (7%)8 (30%)14 (36%)24 (26%)Unknown0000GradeI01 (4%)2 (6%)3 (4%)II2 (9%)10 (44%)8 (24%)20 (25%)III21 (93%)12 (52%)23 (70%)56 (71%)Unknown54615ER\xCE\xB1Negative23 (85%)5 (21%)11 (32%)39 (46%)Positive4 (15%)19 (79%)23 (68%)46 (54%)Unknown1359PgRNegative23 (85%)9 (38%)16 (47%)48 (56%)Positive4 (15%)15 (62%)18 (53%)37 (44%)Unknown1359HER2 statusNegative26 (100%)22 (100%)28 (85%)76 (94%)Positive005 (15%)5 (6%)Unknown25613Endocrine therapyNot given22 (96%)16 (76%)21 (64%)59 (77%)Given1 (4%)5 (24%)12 (36%)18 (23%)Unknown56617ChemotherapyNot given8 (30%)15 (60%)13 (39%)16 (42%)Given19 (70%)10 (40%)20 (61%)49 (58%)Unknown1269n = 94.ImmunohistochemistryTumor-tissue microarrays (1-mm cores), with a twofold redundancy, were prepared from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. RAD21 staining was performed as previously described by using a rabbit polyclonal anti-RAD21 antibody (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) [13]. Nuclear RAD21 expression was assessed for intensity (0, no staining; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong) and the percentage of positive cells (0, 0; 1, < 10%; 2, 10% to 50%; 3, 51% to 80%; 4, > 80% positive cells). The scores for intensity and percentage were added, and a cut-off of 6, the median, was used to define two approximately equal sized groups of patients (with low and high RAD21 expression) for subsequent statistical analyses [13].HER2 chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and immunoperoxidase staining for ER\xCE\xB1, PgR, HER2, CK5/6, and EGFR were performed for all tumors. By using stratification of intrinsic phenotypes based on Nielsen et al. [18], we placed tumors into luminal (ER positive, HER2 negative, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 negative or positive), basal (HER2 and ER negative; CK5/6 positive), HER2 (HER2 positive, ER and CK5/6 negative or positive), and null/negative (HER2, ER, and CK5/6 negative). For HER2, EGFR, and CK5/6, the cut-offs were derived from Neilsen et al. [18]. An Allred score of > 2/8 was considered positive for ER\xCE\xB1 [19].Gene-expression and copy-number analysis of RAD21 Gene-expression and copy-number variation (CNV) data from a cohort of familial breast cancers were derived from a previous study, by using the Illumina Human-6 BeadArray (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the CNV370 SNP array (Illumina), respectively [20]. In this study, the familial tumors were classified into one of the breast tumor subtypes: basal-like, luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and normal-like. These data were used to determine the expression of RAD21 in 75 (19 BRCA1, 30 BRCA2, 25 BRCAX, one unknown) familial breast cancers. Of these 75 cases, 34 had matching CNV data available (11 BRCA1, nine BRCA2, and 14 BRCAX), and 18 had matching protein-expression data as assessed by immunohistochemistry (seven BRCA1, eight BRCA2, three BRCAX). Copy number was determined by using SNP-CGH data for 34 tumors. All data were imported and visualized in Beadstudio v3.2. The logR ratio was used to perform frequency plots of genomic gain or loss by using CGH explorer [21]. R was used to perform SOMATICS [22] to identify regions containing genomic aberrations. The copy number of RAD21 in each tumor was inferred from the average logR value of 22 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were within the RAD21 intron (n = 2) or in sequences flanking the gene (n = 20). All these data are available on GEO (Accession Number GSE19177).microRNA and gene-expression data miningMatching gene-expression and miRNA profiles o
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: f 215 sporadic breast cancer specimens were obtained by mining a microarray dataset described by Buffa et al. [23], in GEO (Accession number GSE22220), samples BCmicroRNA 1 to 110). Normalized log2 signal intensities were obtained after background subtraction and quantile normalization, as previously described by Buffa et al. [23]. This signal intensity for RAD21 was used for survival analysis, as outlined subsequently.microRNA microarraymiRNA expression was assessed for 11 BRCA1 basal breast cancers and 13 normal breast specimens via microarrays. For each sample, 250 ng of total RNA was labeled and hybridized on Human v2 MicroRNA Expression BeadChips (Illumina). The BeadChips were scanned with the Illumina iScan Reader [24]. Data were imported into GenomeStudio (Illumina), from which raw data with background subtraction were exported to the PARTEK Genomics Suite (St. Louis, MO, USA) for further analysis. Raw probe intensities were shifted, such that the minimum probe intensity for each sample was equal to 1. All values were transformed by taking logs (base 2), followed by quantile normalization [25,26]. Probe mapping for Illumina MicroRNA Expression v2 BeadChips was based on miRBase v.12.0 [27].Statistical analysisCorrelations were evaluated by using the Mann-Whitney U or \xCF\x872 tests where appropriate. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated for breast cancer-specific death and were compared with the log rank test. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to identify independent prognostic factors for breast cancer-specific survival. Analyses were performed with SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc., 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, IL, USA). A two-tailed P value test was used in all analyses, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsRAD21 protein expression in familial breast cancers, their relation with intrinsic subtypes and clinicopathologic parametersThe median age of the cohort was 45.6 years. No difference was found in breast cancer-specific survival when stratified by age, by using a cut-off of 40 years (P = 0.442). The tumors in our cohort showed either absent, low, or high RAD21 expression (as defined earlier; Figure 1). With direct comparison of individual expression scores or a median cut-off score, no significant differences in nuclear RAD21 expression were observed between BRCA1 (12 (43%) of 28), BRCA2 (12 (44%) of 27), and BRCAX cancers (12 (33%) of 39) (P = 0.598) (Additional file 2 Table S2a). Similarly, no differences in Rad21 expression were seen within the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes (luminal, 17 (42%) of 41; basal, 14 (44%) of 32; HER2, two (50%) of four; and null, one (20%) of five; P = 0.768) (Additional file 2 Table S2b). No correlation was seen between RAD21 expression and tumor grade, size, lymph node status, or ER or HER2 status (all P > 0.05, Table 2).Figure 1Expression in invasive carcinoma.

Correlation with breast cancer-specific survival was confirmed in a multivariate analysis (including ER, HER2, tumor grade, size, lymph-node status), with RAD21 as a continuous score out of seven (homologous recombination (HR) = 1.66; P = 0.003; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.32; Table 3). Similar to our previous findings in sporadic breast cancers [13], high RAD21 expression correlated with poorer relapse-free survival (P = 0.008) and breast cancer-specific survival for grade 3 familial breast cancers (P = 0.009, Figure 2B) [13], but not for grade 1 and 2 cancers (P = 0.065 and 0.090, respectively).Figure 2Kaplan-Meier curves, breast cancer-specific overall survival stratified by Rad21 expression.

Interestingly, high RAD21 expression correlated with poorer survival in BRCA2 (P = 0.006) (Figure 2C) and BRCAX cancers (P = 0.008) (Figure 2D), but not in BRCA1 cancers (P = 0.71) (Figure 2E). When the intrinsic subtypes were individually analyzed, high RAD21 expression correlated with worse survival in luminal breast cancers (P = 0.010) (Figure 2F). A similar divergence of the survival curves was observed in basal cancers, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.075) (Figure 2G). Insufficient numbers of HER2 and null-type cancers were available for survival analyses to be performed (n = 2 and 3, respectively).High RAD21 expression correlated with shorter survival for patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.036) (Figure 2H). Expression of RAD21 did not correlate with survival in patients receiving hormonal therapy (p = 0.88).Validation of RAD21 expression as a prognostic marker in the cohort of sporadic cancers from Buffa et alThe correlation of RAD21 gene expression to 10-year relapse-free survival was explored in a validation cohort of 215 breast cancer patients, with tumors previously characterized on the Illumina Human RefSeq-8 microarray, by Buffa et al. [23]. Kaplan-Meier curves were charted after stratifying the cohort into two groups, with high RAD21 expression being defined at the 66th percentile (that is, top third of tumors). The same analysis was repeated with the cut-off set at the 50th percentile. High RAD21 expression correlated with poorer survival at both cut-offs (P = 0.007 and P = 0.024, respectively; Figure 3). At a cut-off at the 66th percentile, RAD21 was an independent indicator of 10-year relapse-free survival in a multivariate analysis including ER status, lymph node status, grade, size, and age (HR = 1.62; P = 0.046; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.61).Figure 3The 10-year relapse-free survival of 215 patients from Buffa et al. [23], stratified by RAD21 gene expression.

No significant difference was found in RAD21 gene expression between BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX cancers (P = 0.170, Kruskal-Wallis test). Similarly, no significant difference was noted in RAD21 copy number among the BRCA subtypes (P = 0.141). Similar to our findings in sporadic breast cancers, no difference was seen in RAD21 copy number between basal-like and luminal cancers (P = 0.749). The 34 tumors with both gene-expression and copy-number data showed a significant correlation between RAD21 expression and estimated copy number (r = 0.619; P < 0.001) (Figure 4). Five (15%) of the 34 tumors showed a copy-number gain (copy number of 3). Of these five tumors with copy number gain, there were four basal-like tumors and one luminal tumor.Figure 4Correlation between RAD21 gene copy-number changes as assessed by the average logR array value of 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These were located in RAD21 or within the flanking region of the gene and normalized expression of RAD21 in 34 breast cancers.For 18 tumors, RAD21 gene expression was matched with protein expression, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. This showed a significant correlation between RAD21 gene expression and RAD21 protein expression (of seven) (r = 0.475; P = 0.047) (Figure 5).Figure 5Correlation of RAD21 gene expression with RAD21 immunohistochemistry (score out of 7). r = 0.475; P = 0.047.RAD21 expression is linked with genomic instability in familial breast cancersThirty-four tumors were analyzed for genomic change by using SNP-CGH profiling, as previously described by Waddell et al. [20]. SOMATICS [22] was used to identify copy-number change and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. The total number of chromosomal aberrations and the total number of base pairs affected by genomic change were compared between high RAD21 (top third; n = 11) and low RAD21 (bottom third; n = 11) expressing tumors, as assessed by gene-expression analysis. Tumors with high RAD21 expression had a higher number of base pairs affected by genomic change (mean = 1.92 \xC3\x97 109), compared with tumors with low RAD21 expression (mean = 1.26 \xC3\x97 109; P = 0.048; Figure 6). Although no significant difference was found in the total number of chromosomal aberrations between high and low RAD21-expressing tumors (P = 0.660), 
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: the difference in the number of base pairs affected by genomic change suggests that RAD21 expression is linked with a higher level of genomic instability.Figure 6Comparison of the total number of base pairs affected by genomic change between tumors with low (n = 11) and high (n = 11) RAD21 gene expression, P = 0.048.mir-299-5p is predicted to target RAD21 and inversely correlates with RAD21 expression in sporadic breast cancersA search of potential miRNAs that may target RAD21 was performed on MicroCosm Targets, version 5 [28]. The correlation between RAD21 gene expression and the expression of 15 miRNAs predicted to target RAD21 was interrogated by mining matching gene-expression and miRNA-array data from the cohort of Buffa et al. (108 tumors from miRNA arrays 1 to 110) [23]. Of the 15 miRNAs examined, mir-299-5p inversely correlated with RAD21 expression (Pearson r = -0.294; P = 0.002).DiscussionAlthough RAD21 expression is associated with a poor prognosis and treatment resistance in sporadic breast cancers, the role of RAD21 in familial breast cancers is unclear, as RAD21 expression in the absence of either functional BRCA1 or 2 may not necessarily confer the same predictive and prognostic implications as in sporadic cancers with intact BRCA1/2. We therefore performed the first analysis of RAD21 in a cohort of fully characterized familial breast cancers and investigated potential mechanisms that may mediate RAD21 levels, including DNA copy number and reduced expression of targeting microRNA.Our findings in a cohort of familial breast cancers recapitulated our previous findings in sporadic breast cancers, with enhanced expression of RAD21 occurring in a subset of tumors regardless of grade, size, or intrinsic subtype [13]. Similarly, RAD21 expression conferred a poor prognosis in grade 3, but not in grade 1 or 2 cancers. The previously demonstrated correlation of RAD21 with survival was also confirmed in the cohort of Buffa et al. of sporadic cancers assessed with gene-expression arrays and in our cohort of familial breast cancers.We found that RAD21 expression does not correlate with BRCA status. However, its expression associates with a poor prognosis in BRCA2 and BRCAX cancers. This finding is consistent with our previous findings in sporadic cancers [13]. Interestingly, RAD21 was not associated with a poor prognosis in BRCA1 cancers. How RAD21 expression influences the poor prognosis in BRCA2 and BRCAX but not in BRCA1 patients remains to be determined. This finding is likely to be explained by the final roles of RAD21 and BRCA1/2 in homologous recombination (HR). Like BRCA1 and BRCA2, cohesins are important regulators of genomic stability. Cohesins facilitate error-free repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in DNA by HR, possibly by promoting the alignment and cohesion of sister chromatids [8]. Defects in HR result in DSB repair through the alternative, error-prone, nonhomologous end-joining and single strand-annealing pathways; this may lead to deletions, translocations, and chromosomal instability [29]. HR is particularly important in the repair of DNA damage caused by chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy. Although both BRCA1 and BRCA2 participate in HR, evidence from genetic studies suggests that BRCA1 functions upstream of BRCA2 [30]. Hence, in the setting of BRCA1 cancers in which DSB repair has already been compromised by deleterious BRCA1 mutations, overexpression of RAD21 may have no effect on tumor behavior. Furthermore, removal of the cohesin complex after DNA repair requires proteolytic cleavage of RAD21 by caspase 3 [31]. Activation and translocation of caspase 3 into the nucleus requires functioning wild-type BRCA1 and is inhibited by mutated BRCA1 [32]. Failure to cleave RAD21 due to BRCA1-dependent caspase 3 inhibition may explain loss of HR repair in BRCA1 but not in BRCA2 cancers.Another possible explanation relates to the emerging role of cohesin as a key regulator of gene transcriptions [33,34]. RAD21 is implicated in mediating estrogen-regulated transcription through ER\xCE\xB1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells [9]. Hence RAD21 expression may influence a subset of gene expression through interplay with ER\xCE\xB1, and thereby contribute to the poor prognosis in BRCA2 and BRCX patients. This notion is consistent with ER status in our cohort, in which 85% of BRCA1 tumors are ER\xCE\xB1 negative. Although RAD21 may be implicated in ER-regulated gene expression, functional genomic screens performed on estrogen-dependent cell lines have so far yielded conflicting results regarding the role of RAD21 in tamoxifen resistance. Silencing of RAD21 via sh-RNA suggests that RAD21 expression is associated with sensitivity to tamoxifen [35], whereas transduction by retroviral cDNA suggests that RAD21 expression is associated with resistance [36]. Neither of these findings appears to be reflected by our clinical cohorts, as Rad21 expression did not correlate with survival in either sporadic (P = 0.231) or familial (P = 0.881) breast cancers treated with hormone therapy.Our previous study demonstrated that RAD21 expression is associated with chemotherapy resistance in cell lines and in a cohort of sporadic cancers [13]. Similarly, in our cohort of familial cancers receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, RAD21 expression correlated with a poorer prognosis. This is despite our finding that RAD21 does not correlate with survival in BRCA1 cancers and the higher use of chemotherapy in BRCA1 cancers. This further supports our argument that BRCA1 cancers behave differently from other cancers in response to RAD21 overexpression.Although the function of RAD21 has been extensively investigated in the literature, relatively little is known regarding the regulation of its expression. In keeping with our previous findings in sporadic breast cancers [13], RAD21 gene expression correlated with copy number in our cohort of familial breast cancers. This is further supported by the positive correlation between RAD21 gene expression and protein expression, as assessed by immunohistochemistry in matched tumor samples. Increased RAD21 expression is associated with increased numbers of base pairs being affected by genomic change, which suggests that increased expression is linked to genomic instability. The effect of genomic changes on RAD21 expression appears to be independent of BRCA status and intrinsic tumor subtype. RAD21 upregulation may be an early event that occurs before tumor invasion. This is supported by the presence of increased RAD21 expression in 46% of the DCIS cases we previously examined [13]. In addition, interrogation of the cohort of Schuetz et al. [37] showed no difference in RAD21 expression between 14 microdissected matching invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma samples (P = 0.154).In addition to genomic changes, we postulated that other mechanisms are likely to control RAD21 expression, such as through targeting microRNAs. Of the 15 miRNAs predicted to target RAD21, mir-299-5p expression significantly inversely correlated with RAD21 expression. Reduced circulating mir-299-5p was previously demonstrated in the serum of breast cancer patients [38], compared with normal controls. Silencing of mir-299-5p has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinomas [39]. Limited data derived from breast cancer cell lines showed that mir-299-5p knockdown is associated with upregulation of osteopontin [40], a glycoprotein involved in invasion, metastasis, and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic agents [41,42]. Aberrant regulation of RAD21 by mir-299-5p is also supported by a comparison of 11 BRCA1 basal and 13 normal breast samples, in which a sevenfold reduction in mir-299-5p was observed between BRCA1 cancers and normal breast tissue (P = 0.0002; Figure 7). Nevertheless, although mir-299-5p is clearly reduced in breast cancer, this appears appear to play a relatively minor role in regulating RAD21 expression (r2 = 0.0864; P = 0.002) compared with genomic changes in copy number (r2 = 0.286; P < 0.001).Figure 7Comparison of mir-299-5p expression between BRCA1 basal cancers (n = 11) and normal breast tissue (n = 13).In summary, our findings show that RAD21 expression is associated with a poorer prognosis in BRCA2 and BRCAX, but not in BRCA1 cancers. Because increased RAD21 expression may confer resistance to DNA-damaging agents, alternative treatment strategies may be useful in RAD21-positive BRCA2 and BRCAX cancers. This may include dosage intensification and the use of chemotherapeutic agents with alternative modes of action. The efficacy of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-inhibitor therapy is dependent on defective HR repair [43,44]. In view of the role of RAD21 in increasing HR activity [33], tumor RAD21 status may be particularly relevant in patients being considered for PARP-inhibitor therapy.ConclusionsRAD21 expression in familial cancers is reflected by expression changes in copy-number expression. It is also inversely correlated with mir-299-5p, the expression of which is suppressed in breast cancers. Similar to our earlier findings in sporadic breast cancers, increased RAD21 expression in BRCA2 and BRCAX cancers confers a poor prognosis and resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. This association does not apply to BRCA1 cancers, in which repair by HR between sister chromatids may be compromised by BRCA1 deficiency. RAD21 is thus a potential BRCA1/2 mutation status-dependent predictive and prognostic marker in familial breast cancers.AbbreviationsBRCA1: breast cancer 1, early onset; BRCA2: breast cancer 2, early onset; CGH: chromogenic hybridization; CISH: chromogenic in situ hybridization; CNV: copy-number variation; DCIS: ductal carcinoma in situ; DSB: double-stranded break; ER: estrogen receptor; HER2: human epidermal growth receptor 2; HR: homologous recombination; miRNA: microRNA; PARP: poly-ADP ribose polymerase; SNP: single-nucleotide polymorphism.Comp

In particular, there are notable distinctions between familial female and MBC with a different pattern of penetrance and genotypic phenotypic correlation in BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRCAX subsets [1]. While it is likely that hormonal influence is a significant contributor, as yet, the characterisation of oncogenic drivers by mutation analysis of even the most common gene mutations in MBCs has not been undertaken.Several significant targetable oncogenes are known and relatively well described in female breast cancer (FBC). The most frequent gain of function mutations is seen in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha 9 (PIK3CA) which forms one of the catalytic subunits of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) holoenzyme [3,4]. Mutations of the helical or kinase domain lead to activation of the p110a kinase with subsequent downstream triggering of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) leading to cell proliferation, angiogenesis and promotion of the metastatic process [5,6]. Additional regulators of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway include AKT1 and the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that intersect at multiple points [7-13].Within FBC, the prevalence and prognostic significance of tumours with these driving mutations are unclear and may be dependent on both tumour histological type and estrogen receptor (ER\xCE\xB1) status [14-17]. Notably, in vitro studies propose that activation of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway may be important in tumours with deficient homologous recombination [18], suggesting a possible role in gaining resistance to poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in BRCA1/2 deficient tumours. However, although there are limited data (n = 22), an association between BRCA1/2 loss and activation of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway in human tumours has not been confirmed [15].Despite accruing data in FBC as to the significance of these oncogenes, there are few studies examining somatic mutation in sporadic MBC only [19-23], with the majority of studies focused on gene expression profiling [24-26] and germ-line mutational analysis [27-32].Since the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway is more frequently associated with ER\xCE\xB1 positive FBC, and MBC is largely characterised by ER\xCE\xB1 positive disease, we have examined the frequency of activation of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway and its regulators in a cohort of 57 familial MBCs. While the reported frequency of KRAS and BRAF mutations in female breast cancer is generally low (<5%) reference [33,34], a single sporadic MBC study showing a markedly high percentage of KRAS mutations (12%) also encouraged investigation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which also interacts with the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway. Our aims were to; (1) identify PIK3CA, AKT1, KRAS and BRAF mutations in familial male breast cancer, (2) assess the relationship between such somatic gene mutations and clinicopathological factors, including BRCA1/2 mutation carrier status, and (3) identify and characterise the PIK3CA/mTOR and MAPK pathway and correlate with any clinicopathological factors and survival.Materials and methodsPatient samplesOnly primary breast cancers were examined in this study. Cases were obtained from the kConFab repository [35]. Prerequisites for cases to be included into kConFab are a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) scores [36] generated from family pedigree and stratified by BRCA1/2 mutation carrier status included as Additional file 1: Supplementary figure 1) with criteria for admission to the kConFab study as outlined previously [37]. Cases were from Australia and New Zealand and diagnosed between 1980 and 2009.The flow of patients through the study according to the REMARK criteria [38] is listed in Additional file 2: Supplementary table 1. Of the 118 cases within the kConFab registry, 58 cases were excluded due to unavailability of tissue. Of the 60 cases where tissue was available, 2 cases had insufficient tumour tissue for DNA extraction or for a core to be taken for assembly of a tissue microarray (TMA) and a further single case had an extremely low DNA yield and insufficient material for tissue microarray. Fifty seven cases had sufficient material at an appropriate DNA concentration for somatic mutation testing and one case did not have adequate tissue for TMA construction with all tissue committed to DNA extraction. Clinical parameters, including disease specific mortality were obtained from referring clinical centres, kConFab questionnaires and state death registries. Information on pedigree, mutational status and testing were available from the kConFab central registry. Histological classification was based on criteria set by the World Health Organization 2012 [39] and all slides and pathological records from all cases were reviewed for tumour size, tumour grade, lymphovascular and perineural invasion. Immunohistochemistry for ER\xCE\xB1, progesterone receptor (PgR), basal markers (cytokeratin (CK) 5, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) and HER2 silver in situ hybridisation (SISH) had been performed as previously reported [1]. Using stratification of intrinsic phenotypes based on Nielsen et al. [40], tumours were placed into luminal (ER\xCE\xB1 positive, HER2 negative, CK5 and/or EGFR negative or positive), basal (HER2 and ER\xCE\xB1 negative; CK5 and/or EGFR positive), HER2 (HER2 positive, ER\xCE\xB1, CK5 and EGFR negative or positive) and null/negative (HER2, ER\xCE\xB1, CK5 and EGFR negative) phenotypes. This work was carried out with approval from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Ethics Committee (Project No: 11/61). The approval included waiver of patient consent.Germline BRCA1/2 testingMutation testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was performed as reported previously [1]. Testing of index cases in kConFab families was carried out by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Once the family mutation had been identified, all pathogenic (including splice site) variants of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were genotyped by kConFab in all available family members' DNA.High-Resolution Melting (HRM) assayGenomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. A 3 \xCE\xBCM haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slide was cut from FFPE blocks and stained to identify tumour enriched areas. From the relevant area on the FFPE block, a 2 mm punch biopsy core was taken. The cores were then dewaxed and hydrated through gradient alcohol. Genomic DNA was then extracted using the DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA)) following proteinase K digestion at 56\xC2\xB0C for three days.The PIK3CA, AKT1, BRAF and KRAS primer sequences are shown in Additional file 3: Supplementary table 2. PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 primers produced amplicons with 104 base pairs (bp) and 102 bp, respectively. AKT1 exon 4, BRAF exon 15 and KRAS exon 4 primers produced 78 bp, 144 bp and 92 bp amplicons, respectively. PCR for HRM analysis was performed in 0.1 ml tubes on a Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) utilising the fluorescent DNA intercalating dye, SYTO 9 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A 20 \xCE\xBCL final reaction volume contained 1 \xC3\x97 PCR buffer, 0.5 to 2.0 mM MgCl2, 200 to 400 nM of forward and reverse primer, 200 \xCE\xBCM of dNTPs, 5 \xCE\xBCM of SYTO 9, 0.5 U of HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen), 5 ng of genomic DNA, Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) (0.5 units/reaction), UDG buffer (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and PCR grade water. The cycling and melting conditions are shown in Additional file 3: Supplementary table 2. All reactions had initial UDG treatment for FFPE artefacts at 37\xC2\xB0C for 30 minutes [41], followed by an incubation step at 95\xC2\xB0C for 15 minutes, denaturatio

A single cycle of 97\xC2\xB0C for one minute preceded a melt phase run between temperatures listed in Additional file 3: Supplementary table 2 and rising 0.2\xC2\xB0C per step. Samples were run in duplicate. HRM analysis was performed on the Rotor-Gene Q Software (v1.7) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).DNA sequencingAll samples with either or both duplicates showing abnormal melt were sequenced for detection of mutations. PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 HRM products were amplified using M13 tagged primers (Additional file 3: Supplementary table 2) initially and then M13 primers for a second step for PIK3CA exon 9 (amplicon 185 bp) and a single step PCR reaction for PIK3CA exon 20 (amplicon 149 bp) using primers listed in Additional file 3: Supplementary table 2. The composition of a total reaction mixture of 20 \xCE\xBCL contained; 1 \xC3\x97 PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 400 nM of each primer, 200 \xCE\xBCM of dNTPs, 0.5 U of HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen), 5 ng of HRM DNA products and PCR grade water. The PCR conditions were as follows: an initial incubation at 95\xC2\xB0C for 1 minute, followed by 35 cycles of 95\xC2\xB0C for 10 seconds, 55\xC2\xB0C for 10 seconds and 72\xC2\xB0C for 4 minutes. The sequencing reaction was then performed using the Big Dye Terminator v3.1 chemistry according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using 6 \xCE\xBCL of the PCR products that were purified with 2 \xCE\xBCL of ExoSapIT (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). After ethanol precipitation, the sequencing products were run on a 3700 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing data were then analysed using Sequencher 4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing a second independent PCR reaction. The work flow is outlined in Figure 1.Figure 1Work flow of sample analysis. Initial High-Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis was used to screen mutation by abnormal melt. Sanger sequencing was then performed to detect specific mutations.ImmunohistochemistryTumour-tissue microarrays (1-mm cores), with a two-fold redundancy, were prepared from archival FFPE tissue blocks. TMA sections were cut from each block at 4 \xCE\xBCm thick intervals, dewaxed, placed through graded alcohol and then into water.For phosphorylated 4EBP1 (p4EBP1) and phosphorylated S6 (pS6), antigen retrieval was performed using high pH antigen retrieval buffer (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) in pressure cooker for three minutes at 125\xC2\xB0C. For phosphorylated AKT1 (pAKT), antigen retrieval was performed with CC1 high pH retrieval solution (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) at 100\xC2\xB0C for 36 minutes. Staining for p4EBP1 (dilution 1:400, clone 2855, Cell Signalling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and pS6 (dilution 1:200, clone 2211, Cell Signalling Technology) was performed using a monoclonal and polyclonal rabbit antibodies respectively. Antigen-antibody complex was detected using the Envision FLEX system (EnVision FLEX/HRP and EnVision FLEX DAB + Chromogen, DAKO). Staining for pAKT1 (dilution 1:1,000, clone LP18, Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) was performed using a monoclonal mouse antibody with secondary detection using Ventana Ultraview detection reagents (Roche). Slides were then counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared and mounted for assessment. Phosphorylated 4EBP1 expression was assessed for both cytoplasmic and nuclear expression, nuclear expression for pAKT1 and cytoplasmic expression for pS6 (Figure 2a). A histoscore was generated by multiplying staining intensity (0, no staining; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong) by the percentage of positive tumour cells (0, 0; 1, < or = to 25%; 2, >25% to 50%; 3, >50% to 75%, 4, >75%). The histoscores ranged between 0 and 12. For subsequent analysis, histoscores were categorised into either absent (histoscore = 0) or present (1 to 12) or low (0 to 3) and high (4 to 12) to differentiate from baseline staining of adjacent normal breast epithelium.Figure 2PIK3CA/mTOR pathway (# 4EBP1 is inactivated by phosphorylation) a).

Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted using breast cancer related death as the endpoint and compared using a log rank test. Analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Prism version 5.04 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). A two-tailed P-value test was used in all analyses and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsPIK3CA is commonly mutated in familial male breast cancerSeven PIK3CA mutations were identified and confirmed in six samples (Table 1). Four activating mutations were identified in exon 9, with two cases of E547K mutation and one sample demonstrated concurrent E542K and E547K mutations in exon 9. Three further mutations were identified in exon 20, all of which were H1047R mutations. Screening of AKT1, BRAF and KRAS showed no evidence of somatic mutations.Table 1Somatic PIK3CA mutations in familial male breast cancerNucleotide changeAmino acid changeBRCA statusc.1624G>Ap.E542KBRCAXc.1639G>Ap.E547KBRCAXc.1624G>A, c.1639G>Ap.E542K, p.E547KBRCAXc.3140A>Gp.H1047RBRCAXc.3140A>Gp.H1047RBRCAXc.3140A>Gp.H1047RBRCA1 del exons 21_24PIK3CA mutation is uncommonly seen in BRCA2 mutation carriersOne tumour arising in a BRCA1 carrier had an exon 20 PIK3CA mutation, five PIK3CA mutations occurred in BRCAX males whereas no PIK3CA mutation were identified in tumours from BRCA2 mutation carriers.

We identified a PIK3CA mutation rate of 10.5% in familial MBCs but an absence of common activating mutations of AKT1, KRAS and BRAF. While limited by moderate numbers in our study, the absence of KRAS mutation contrasts with the only other study performed in sporadic MBCs by Dawson et al. who reported an overall incidence of 12% [20]. Methodological reasons may be underlying these difference but in our experience, HRM is a highly sensitive and robust technique [42,43]. The absence of BRAF mutation is also somewhat expected and is supported by the stronger association between basal cell breast cancer lines and BRAF mutation [44] (since the majority of MBCs are of a luminal subtype). While a true frequency of these mutations requires further testing in a much larger cohort, these data suggest frequency is unlikely to be high and should parallel the range (0.7 to 5%) that is observed in female breast cancer.The mutation rate of PIK3CA in this series is lower than the reported 17.9% (7/39) in the only other study performed, although this was in a population-based cohort of MBCs patients [19]. It is also less frequent than that reported in FBC (16.3% [19] to 40.0% [3]) (Table 4), which supports the notion that male breast cancer is biologically different from female breast cancer and that therapies that rely on the experience of the female disease are likely to be suboptimal. Furthermore, evidence from our data demonstrating that differences in this PIK3CA/mTOR pathway is dependent on the germline genotypes of male breast cancer, shows the basis of male breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers is very different to that of BRCAX giving further credence to personalising breast cancer treatment whether male or female using individual patient and tumour characteristics. Thus, as the incidence of PIK3CA mutations in tumours from in BRCA2 carriers is likely to be negligible, these patients are unlikely to derive benefits from the PIK3CA inhibitors that are now entering clinical trials for female breast cancer [19].Table 4Comparison of PIK3CA mutation studies in male and female breast cancerMale Breast CancerFemale Breast CancerCurrent StudyBenvenuti S et al.

(Table 4) showed exclusively exon 20 mutations in MBC, supporting the suggestion that the frequency of exon 9 and 20 mutations may be gender and tissue specific. We, however, noted an equal distribution of exon 9 and 20 mutations, which is more reflective of the distribution seen by others in FBC [3,14]. Furthermore, the E547K mutation noted in two of our BRCAX patients has only once previously been reported in a single female breast cancer suggestive of a unique hot spot preferentially within male cancers. This mutation was detected and confirmed using HRM and Sanger sequencing in duplicate for each case using methodologies optimised for FFPE material. We have extensive experience with this methodology and feel it to be well suited and robust for formalin fixed paraffin embedded material. While we also acknowledge the occurrence of artifactual changes, the E547K mutation has not been detected in over 300 FFPE tumour samples we have screened to date (unpublished data) and thus, we feel that this mutation may be particular to a subset of MBC. The E547K mutation itself is found in the highly conserved helical domain of PIK3CA and possibly confers increased catalytic activity. The mutation is not unique to breast cancer, and has also been reported previously in one colorectal adenocarcinoma [45] and in seven neuroendocrine tumours of the lung [46] lending support for a true pathogenic mutation. Targeted sequencing of further MBC, and in particular non-BRCA2 tumours, may help determine a more accurate incidence and potential relevance of this uncommon mutation. We also observed a case with two concurrent exon 9 mutations, which has not been previously reported in MBC. While there is some suggestion of a more aggressive phenotype or of tumour heterogeneity in cases with dual PIK3CA mutations [16,47,48], the clinical significance of this is also unclear due to the infrequency of this observation.Recent data show that BRCA2 appears to be a significant driver in MBC, with a considerably higher penetrance within male BRCA2 carriers compared with males in BRCAX families and BRCA1 male mutation carriers [1]. It is also noteworthy that BRCA2 somatic mutations have also been reported in 21.8% of sporadic MBCs [22]. Furthermore, unlike in FBC, studies by Ottini et al. [49] and ourselves [1] intimate a distinct BRCA2 phenotype in MBCs, which more commonly contain areas of micropapillary histology, are of a higher grade, are PgR negative and are HER2 amplified. The genomic findings of this study emphasize that BRCA2 tumours may be a distinct subgroup in familial MBC and as such BRCA2 mutation may be a significant driver in MBC. Further support for a strong inherent BRCA2 associated drive independent of gender and estrogenic influence in male breast cancer is the association of PIK3CA mutation and ER\xCE\xB1 positive female breast cancer [14-17], a phenotype which is common to BRCA2 associated male tumours (92%) [1], but without the associated rate of PIK3CA mutation. These data suggest that gender and hormonal dimorphism may not be so significant in BRCA2 carriers and that BRCA2 male breast cancers align with the non-PIK3CA mutated ER\xCE\xB1 positive group of female breast cancer.PIK3CA oncogenic drive, however, may be more important in non-BRCA2 MBCs where estrogenic influences may be more prominent. While our previous studies have shown that ER\xCE\xB1 and PgR positive tumours were seen at a similar frequency across all BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRCAX cohorts and more commonly than in FBC [1], based on this genotypic analysis, the mechanism and effect of PIK3CA mutation is likely to be different between the subgroups. Overall, given the association between ER\xCE\xB1 positive tumours and increased PIK3CA mutation frequency in FBC, one would assume an increased rate of PIK3CA mutation in MBCs. This is not seen and may suggest alternate receptor and PIK3CA/mTOR interaction in male breast cancer or a dose-based relationship differentiated by male cancers with low estrogen at one end of the spectrum and higher levels of estrogen in females at the opposite end. While studies have extensively examined the correlation between hormone receptor status and incidence of PIK3CA mutation, as yet there are very limited data on the effect of circulating oestradiol on PIK3CA mutation rate with some suggestion that PIK3CA/mTOR activation may contribute to tamoxifen-resistance. Further evidence of estrogen influence is also provided by Benvenuti et al. who observed a gender bias for PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer with a higher incidence of mutations in women (23%) compared with men (9%) [19] (Table 4), which reflect the findings of our study. Further study correlating serum oestradiol, testosterone levels and PIK3CA mutation frequency in MBCs are required to further elaborate on a possible association.Recent in vitro studies showing increased sensitization of cancers with defects in DNA homologous recombination (as seen in BRCA1/2 deficient cancers), to PARP inhibition by targeting of PIK3CA [18,50] suggest that PIK3CA/mTOR pathway interactions result in homologous recombination steady state. Support for the model is not yet seen in vivo with only one study to date to have examined a correlation between BRCA mutation carriers' status and PIK3CA mutation incidence in FBC. Limited by numbers, Michelucci et al. describe two mutations (one codon 9 and one codon 20) in 12 BRCA2 mutation carriers and no mutations in 10 BRCA1 mutation carriers [15]. The clinical value of this dual targeting is unknown in BRCA1/2 FBCs and whether it is male or female, this study is also the first to describe a PIK3CA somatic mutation in a BRCA1 mutation carrier. The low numbers of MBCs in BRCA1 mutation carriers in our study reflects the paucity of these tumours in this particular cohort, and in BRCA1 carriers in general [51-54]. What is apparent is that BRCA1-associated tumours in males appear to be more similar to the tumours seen in post-menopausal female BRCA1 carriers, with an absence of tumours arising in young patients and an absence of an association with basal cell phenotype. Notwithstanding, carrying a BRCA1 mutation does appears to be a risk factor for MBC with a higher incidence than that of the general population but at much lower penetrance than s

While the findings in this study are novel, true incidence and relevance of PIK3CA mutations in this cohort require further investigation of larger numbers of BRCA1 patients, if these can be acquired for study.The alignment of PIK3CA mutation with elevated pS6 expression and absent p4EBP1 expression is different to the expected model. Theoretically, PIK3CA mutational activation of the pathway should only lead to an elevated pS6, as is seen, but not an elevated p4EBP1 (the phosphorylated form being inactive) and pAKT, which is not observed. This is in part likely to be due to the complexity of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway. Indeed, a correlation between PIK3CA mutation in luminal A FBC (the phenotype most similar to MBC) and combined up-regulation of pAKT, p4EBP1 and pS6 is not seen [55]. The association seen in the series between PIK3CA mutation and elevated pS6 (P = 0.024) may suggest partial activation of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway in MBC and reflect the variability of pS6 and p4EBP1 and pAKT levels seen in vitro with dose dependent inhibition of mTORC1 [56], or interactions of mTORC2, other pathways and feedback loops.Nevertheless, we observed up-regulation of p4EBP1 in BRCA2 mutation carriers (68.0%) more frequently than in BRCAX carriers (36.7%), an association not reported in FBC, giving further evidence to the difference in male and female breast cancers. It may be that an alternate mechanism of PIK3CA/mTOR pathway activation may be present in BRCA2 cases linked to disordered homologous recombination, as mentioned previously, through p4EBP1 and eIF4e.ConclusionThe results of this study indicate that somatic PIK3CA mutation are a frequent alteration in familial MBC of BRCAX families, the incidence and type of which is comparable to that seen in sporadic male and slightly lower than FBCs. Conversely, the absence of PIK3CA mutation in BRCA2 associated MBCs suggests that alternate oncogenic drivers minimally contribute to tumour drive in this group, thus supporting distinct male breast cancer types. The study has also revealed differences of MBC to FBC and between sporadic and familial MBC which are of importance in optimising treatment strategies and underlying relevance of the PIK3CA/mTOR pathway in tumour biology. Indeed, the therapeutic implications of these findings support the delineation of significant molecular pathways, such as PIK3CA/mTOR and MAPK cascades for subsequent targeted therapies within specific populations.AbbreviationsBOADICEA: Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm; Bp: base pairs; CK: cytokeratin; DSS: disease specific survival; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; ER\xCE\xB1: estrogen receptor alpha; FBC: female breast cancer; FFPE: formalin fixed paraffin embedded; H&E: haematoxylin and eosin; HRM: high resolution melt; IC-NST: invasive carcinoma of no special type; MAPK: mitogen activated pathway kinase; MBC: male breast cancer; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORC: mammalian target of rapamycin complex; pAKT: phosphorylated AKT; PARP: poly ADP ribose polymerase; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIK3CA: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha; PgR: progesterone receptor; pS6: phosphorylated S6; p4EBP1: phosphorylated 4EBP1; SISH: silver in situ hybridization; TMA: tissue microarray; UDG: uracil DNA glycosylase.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsAD performed the manuscript review, contributed to study concept and design and the HRM assay design.

Most cases are classified as \xE2\x80\x98sporadic\xE2\x80\x99 breast carcinoma caused by genetic changes that occur over time [2], and only a small percentage (5\xE2\x80\x9310%) is of hereditary origin. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the major cause of the hereditary form of the disease. The two genes may account for less than 30% of the genetic information responsible for heritable breast cancer, indicating that other genes could have a role in hereditary tumors with no BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, the so-called non-BRCA1/2 familial tumors (BRCAx) [3], [4], [5], [6].In the last few years, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling has emerged as a useful tool to stratify tumors and pinpoint miRNAs involved in specific steps of cancer progression [7], [8], [9]. These tiny, non-coding RNAs of 18\xE2\x80\x9325 nucleotides in length, function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression by binding the 3\xE2\x80\xB2 untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs and promoting mRNA degradation or translational repression [10]. Several studies demonstrated that miRNAs can regulate the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors [11]. In breast cancer, miRNA expression profiling using microarray technology in association with some biopathological features such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status has been established as a useful tool to classify tumors [12], [13], [14], [15]. As ER, PR and HER2 are the molecular biomarkers currently used in routine clinical practice to help treatment decision in breast cancer, the identification of miRNAs whose expression could be related to their status could help to discover new molecular alterations involved in this tumor type [16].In this study, we analyzed miRNA expression profiling of a group of heredo-familial and sporadic breast cancers. The classification of the samples according to their estrogen receptor status highlighted a strong association of ER with miR-342 expression levels. Further investigations led us to study ID4, a putative target of this miRNA, and its interaction with BRCA1. After demonstrating this mechanism in an in vitro model, we hypothesized that in our cohort of cases it could be involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, in particular in BRCAx familial cases.Materials and MethodsEthics StatementThis study was approved by the Independent Ethical Committee of the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan (INT), and each patient provided written informed consent to donate the tissues left over after diagnostic procedures for research purposes.Breast Cancer SpecimensThe study analyzed fifty-two specimens from 51 patients with breast cancer; the specimens were collected at INT during the period 1983\xE2\x80\x932003. The samples included 12 sporadic breast cancers (patients with a negative family history and age of onset >40 years) and 40 specimens with familial breast cancer. For one patient that developed bilateral disease both tumors were available and analyzed. All familial patients had early onset and/or positive family history, matched criteria for BRCA1 and BRCA2 molecular analysis used at INT [17], and did not overlap with any other known hereditary cancer syndromes. All familial patients underwent genetic counseling, with pedigree reconstruction going back for at least three generations, and were offered genetic testing (see Table S1 for features of cases). Tumor specimens containing more than 80% neoplastic cells were selected by an experienced pathologist from cryopreserved samples. Table S1 summarizes the clinical and histopathological features of the analyzed samples.ER and PR status was routinely evaluated at time of diagnostic procedure according to the EORTC recommendations and within national [18] and international quality control programs by a ligand binding assay [19] and expressed as fmol mg\xE2\x88\x921 of protein. Tumors with an ER concentration higher than 10 fmol mg\xE2\x88\x921 of protein or with a PR concentration higher than 25 fmol mg\xE2\x88\x921 of protein were defined as ER-positive or PR-positive, respectively.

Cells were tested and authenticated using the StemElite ID System (Promega). Each cell line was grown in a specific medium: BT20 in DMEM +10% fetal bovine serum; MDA-MB-231 in RPMI +5% fetal bovine serum; HCC1937 in RPMI +15% fetal bovine serum; MCF7 in MEM +10% fetal bovine insulin +0.01 mg/ml+1% NEAA (MEM Non Essential Amminoacids) +1% Sodium Pyruvate; T47D in DMEM +10% fetal bovine serum; 293T in DMEM +10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were maintained as a monolayer in a humidified incubator at 37\xC2\xB0C with a supply of 5% CO2.miRNA Expression AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted from tissue samples using Trizol (Life Technologies) and DNase I treated (Quiagen) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s protocol.MicroRNA microarray profiling was performed for the 52 samples as described in [11], [20]. Briefly, 5 \xC2\xB5g of total RNA was labeled and hybridized to each microRNA microarray containing 368 probes, including 245 human and mouse miRNA genes, in triplicate. Scanner images were quantified by the Quantarray software (Perkin-Elmer). Poor signal quality of background-corrected intensities were flagged and removed from the analysis, all intensities below 200 were thresholded to the value of 200; the expression values were log2 transformed and a Lowess normalization [21] was applied to each slide, using the internal replicates for the normalization. The normalized log2-tranformed expression ratios (sample/reference) of each miRNA were averaged and the arrays were median centered. Only human miRNAs (hsa-miR) were used for further analyses. The miRNA data sets were filtered by removing miRNAs with more than 50% missing (invalid) values. MiRNAs expression data have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE46966.Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)The RNA expressions of ESR1, PGR, ERBB2, BRCA1 and ID4 were measured by qRT-PCR on 1 \xC2\xB5g of the same RNA used for miRNA analysis and on 1 \xC2\xB5g of RNA extracted from the breast cancer cell lines with the same procedures used for the tissue specimens. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit and TaqMan reactions were performed in duplicate using TaqMan Assays-on-Demand Gene Expression Products (ESR1 Hs00174860_m1, PgRHs00172183_m1, HER2 Hs00170433_m1, ID4 Hs00155465_m1, BRCA1 Hs00173233_m1, Applied Biosystems). For miR-342 expression analysis, 30 ng of total RNA in a final volume of 15 \xC2\xB5L was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit and miR-342 specific primers (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions. RT-qPCR was conducted using FAST chemistry (Applied Biosystems) in ABI PRISM 7700 and 7900 HT Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). To normalize data, 18S ribosomal subunit and GAPDH were used as housekeeping (4319413E, Hs99999905_m1, Applied Biosystems). The expression values of the miR-342 (002260) were normalized to RNU6B (001093). Data analysis was performed using the Sequence Detector v1.9 software.Identification of miRNAs Associated with Estrogen, Progesterone and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Expression and StatusIn order to identify the miRNAs associated with the estrogen receptor we fitted a linear regression model of each miRNA, using the normalized intensity of the miRNA as the outcome and the (log2-transformed) ESR1 expression (measured using qRT-PCR) as a covariate; similarly, we used the estrogen receptor status (ER-positive or ER-negative) as a covariate to identify the miRNAs associated with the ER status. We identified the miRNAs associated with progesterone and epidermal growth factor 2 receptors expression/status using similar models. The associations were considered statistically significant if the P values were less than 0.01.To adjust the analysis for the presence of a possible batch effect in the miRNA experiment, all miRNA analyses were adjusted to the day on which the experiment was performed.Evaluation of the Association of BRCA1 with Genes Involved in Breast Cancer (ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1) and miR-342Using patients\xE2\x80\x99 samples, we examined the association of BRCA1 gene expression with the expression of ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1 and miR-342. The association was assessed fitting a multivariable linear regression model in which BRCA1 expression was the outcome variable and the expression of the genes and of miR-342 were the covariates; we also included an interaction term between the ER status and miR-342. The expression of the genes was evaluated using qRT-PCR, while the expression of miR-342 was measured on the miRNA arrays.Independent Case Series Used to Validate the ResultsPublicly available data on mRNA and miRNA expression of breast cancers were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [22].mRNA expression levels of BRCA1, ID4, ESR1, PGR and ERBB2, as well as ER and PR status, were available for 526 breast cancer patients; for 288 of them miR-342 expression was also available. Fifteen patients were BRCA1-mutant (12/15 with ER-positive status) and 22 were BRCA2-mutant (15/21 with ER-positive status). Family history of patients was not available, therefore all the other samples were classified as sporadics (384/485). Twenty two out of the 228 patients for which the information was available had an amplification of ERBB2.Computational AspectsAll the analyses were performed using BRB-ArrayTools v3.1 developed by Dr Richard Simon and Amy Peng Lam and R language for statistical computing (Development Core Team (2009).

Accessed November 24, 2012).Dual Luciferase AssaysThe 3\xE2\x80\xB2 UTR region of ID4 gene (471 base pairs of length) containing the predicted miR-342 binding site was amplified by using the following primers:For 5\xE2\x80\xB2-TCTAGATTTGTGACCAAGGAGCTCAA-3\xE2\x80\xB2,Rev 5\xE2\x80\xB2-TCTAGATGCAATCATGCAAGACCACT-3\xE2\x80\xB2.The PCR product was then digested with XbaI enzyme and cloned into the reporter plasmid pGL3 Promoter (Promega) downstream of the luciferase gene.For reporter assays, 5\xC3\x97104 293T cells were seeded in 24 well plates and grown for 24 h. Subsequently, 0.1 \xC2\xB5g of the pLuc ID4 3\xE2\x80\xB2 UTR construct together with 0.01 \xC2\xB5g of Renilla luciferase pRLTK plasmid (Promega) were cotransfected with 100 nM of pre-miR-342 (mature sequence: UCUCACACAGAAAUCGCACCCGU, ID:PM12328) or pre-miR-1 (mature sequence: UGGAAUGUAAAGAAGUAUGUAU, ID: PM10617) or with pre-miR negative control#1 (Pre-miR-TM miRNA Precursor Molecule, Negative Control #1, ID: AM17110; Ambion) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions. After 24 hours, the luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla activity to control the transfection efficiency.Transfection of miR-342 and miR Negative Control Precursor MoleculesThe day before transfection, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells were seeded at a density of 25\xC3\x97104 in 60-mm dishes. Pre-miR-342 precursor molecule and pre-miR negative control#1 (scramble) were transfected at a final concentration of 100 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions. MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of 35\xC3\x97104 in 60-mm dishes and transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions.ID4 SilencingMDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a siRNA pool of four oligonucleotides (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool) targeting different portions of ID4 gene (ThermoScientific Dharmacon), at a final concentration of 25 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 24 hours these cells were transfected with 100 nM of pre-miR-342 precursor molecule and collected 48 hours after the second transfection for RNA extraction and protein lysates.Western BlottingWestern blots were carried out for ID4 and BRCA1 protein. Seventy two hours after transfection with miR-342 precursor or negative control, MDA-MB-231, HCC1937 and MCF7 cells were collected by trypsinization and resuspended in 300 ul of 1X SDS sample buffer (62.5 Mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM DTT), supplemented with protease inhibitors cocktail (Calbiochem).Protein quantification was performed using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Forty micrograms of protein extract were loaded on 7% to 15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-ID4 (82-12, dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB61000, Calbioreagents), anti-BRCA1 (dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB6800, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-\xCE\xB2-Actin (dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB65000, MP Biomedicals), anti-Vinculin (dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB65000, Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-\xCE\xB1-Tubulin (dilution 1\xE2\x88\xB65000, Sigma-Aldrich). Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Scientific).Protein level quantification was performed using the software Imagelab\xC2\xA9, by subtracting the global background of each membrane from the volume of intensity of the antibody detection bands (rectangle enco

The level of a protein in a certain sample was measured as the ratio between the quantifications of the band for the specific-antibody and the band for loading control.ResultsmiRNAs Expression Profile AnalysisWe obtained the miRNA profiles of 52 breast cancer tumors through hybridization on a custom microarray platform already validated by numerous studies [11]. The 52 samples included 15 positive cases for mutations of BRCA1 gene (BRCA1-mutant cases), 10 positive cases for mutations of BRCA2 gene (BRCA2-mutant cases), 15 cases with evidence of hereditary predisposition to breast cancer but without pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (BRCAx cases) and 12 cases not eligible for BRCA testing and with negative familial history (sporadic cases). Their main characteristics are reported in Table S1.We evaluated the association of the miRNA profiles with estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptors, measured both at mRNA expression levels (defined as ESR1, PGR and ERBB2), obtained by qRT-PCR, and at protein levels (defined as ER, PR and HER2) and classified positive or negative (status) as described in materials and methods. Regarding mRNA expression, we identified 22 miRNAs significantly associated to ESR1, 12 miRNAs associated to PGR and 11 related to ERBB2 levels (P<0.05). Dividing samples according to their protein levels for the three studied markers (status), 14 miRNAs were associated to ER, 5 to PR and 4 to HER2 status (P<0.05) (Table S2 and Figure S1).miR-342 had the strongest positive correlation with ESR1 expression (Pearson correlation r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.5, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.0001, Figure 1A) and had the biggest average difference between patients with ER-positive status and those with ER-negative status (Figure 1B and Figure S1). We estimated that patients with ER-positive status had on average 2.1 times higher miR-342 expression compared to patients with ER-negative status (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.0002, two-sample t-test, Figure 1B). A very similar association between ER and miR-342 was observed on the TCGA data set (Figure S2).10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g001Figure 1miR-342 expression in patients according to ESR1 expression levels or ER status.(A) Positive correlation of log2 normalized expression of miR-342 detected on miRNA arrays and log2 transformed ESR1 levels measured by qRT-PCR in the patients analyzed. The dashed line was obtained using a linear regression model. (B) Box plot representation of miR-342 expression according to estrogen receptor negative or positive status of the patients analyzed.miR-342 Directly Targets ID4In three public databases for miRNA targets prediction (microRNA.org, release August 2010; TargetScan 6.2 and PicTar, release March 2007), we searched for putative 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR gene targets of miR-342. We focused on the ID4 gene that was a predicted target of miR-342 in all the three databases. ID4 belongs to a family of dominant negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and is highly expressed in diverse cancer types, including breast cancer [23]. The expression of this gene has also been found inversely correlated with that of ER status [24].We evaluated the expression levels of ID4 in our cohort of patients by qRT-PCR. We confirmed a negative correlation between ID4 and ESR1 expression (r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A\xE2\x88\x920.62, P<0.0001) and found that ER-positive patients on average had three times smaller ID4 expression compared to ER-negative patients (95% CI: 1.6 to 5.8, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.002) (Figure 2). In our samples, miR-342 and ID4 had opposite expression compared to estrogen receptor, suggesting an interplay among them. In fact, a negative correlation between miR-342 array and ID4 expression data was observed in our cohort of cases (r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A\xE2\x88\x920.44, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.002) (Figure 3). Association of ID4, ESR1 and miR-342 was very similar also in the TCGA data set (Figures S3 and S4).10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g002Figure 2ID4 expression in patients according to ESR1 expression levels or ER status.(A) Negative correlation of ID4 expression and ESR1 levels both measured by qRT-PCR analysis. The dashed line was obtained using a linear regression model. (B) Box plot representation of ID4 expression considering estrogen receptor negative or positive status of the patients analyzed.10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g003Figure 3Expression of miR-342 and ID4 in patients.Negative correlation of ID4 expression measured by qRT-PCR and miR-342 levels detected by miRNA arrays. Samples are represented according to their positive/negative estrogen receptor status. The dashed line was obtained using a linear regression model.In our data the association between ID4 and miR-342 was attenuated when the analysis was adjusted for ESR1 expression: in the linear regression models with ID4 used as a dependent variable, the regression coefficient of miR-342 was \xE2\x88\x920.69 (95% CI: \xE2\x88\x921.1 to \xE2\x88\x920.27, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.002) in the univariable model, and \xE2\x88\x920.31 (95% CI: \xE2\x88\x920.71 to 0.10, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.12) in the model adjusted for the expression of ESR1. A similar result was observed also in the TCGA data set, where the association between ID4 and miR-342 was attenuated but it remained statistically significant in the ESR1 adjusted analysis (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.008, regression coefficients \xE2\x88\x920.35 and \xE2\x88\x920.16 in univariable and adjusted analysis, respectively). To functionally validate miR-342 binding to the 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR of the ID4 gene and its potential inhibitory effect on this gene, an in vitro model was constructed using a reporter luciferase system. The resulting vector, pLuc ID4-3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR, contained the 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR region of ID4 gene with the predicted miR-342 binding site downstream the Luciferase gene (Figure 4A). pLuc ID4-3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR vector was cotransfected in 293T cells either with miR-342 precursor molecule, another precursor molecule containing a seed region that does not bind to ID4 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR (miR-1) or a scramble oligonucleotide. Sequences of miR-1 used as aspecific miRNA and of the scramble oligonucleotide were both used as negative controls. As shown in Figure 4B, miR-342 overexpression significantly decreased the luciferase activity compared to the scramble oligonucleotide (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.002). By contrast, transfection of pLuc ID4-3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR construct with miR-1 precursor, which has no predicted binding sites for ID4 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR, prevented the down-regulation of luciferase expression. This result indicated that the reduction of luciferase activity was miR-342 specific and that there was a direct interaction between miR-342 and ID4 gene.10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g004Figure 4miR-342 directly regulates ID4.(A) The 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR of ID4 gene containing the predicted miR-342 binding site was cloned into pGL3-promoter vector. This construct was cotransfected with precursor molecules of miR-342 or of miR-1 (whose seed region has no affinity for ID4 3\xE2\x80\xB2 UTR). (B) Relative luciferase activity in 293T cells was determined after transfection. A scramble oligonucleotide was used as negative control of transfection.Correlation between ID4 and BRCA1 Expression through miR-342As ID4 can regulate the transcription of BRCA1 [25], we investigated a possible association between the expression levels of these two genes in our cohort of patients. Using a qRT-PCR approach, we observed a negative correlation between ID4 and BRCA1 gene expression (r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A\xE2\x88\x920.26, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.07) in our case series (Figure 5A). A similar negative correlation was observed also in the TCGA data set (r\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A\xE2\x88\x920.28, P<0.0001, Figure S5A). Classification of samples according to their sporadic or heredo-familial status (BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutant and BRCAx) showed a different trend of expression of the two genes. BRCA1-mutant and BRCAx cases had higher expression of ID4 and lower expression of BRCA1 compared to sporadic and BRCA2-mutant samples (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.07, Figure 5B). We observed a similar pattern also in the TCGA data set (Figure S5B, P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.0013).10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g005Figure 5Expression of ID4 and BRCA1 in patients.(A) Negative correlation of ID4 expression and BRCA1 levels both measured by qRT-PCR analysis. The dashed line was obtained using a linear regression model. (B) Differences between delta Ct values of ID4 and BRCA1 in patients divided into hereditary (BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutant), familial (BRCAx) or sporadic groups.Having showed that ID4 is a direct target of miR-342, we hypothesized that modulation of ID4 operated by miR-342 could provide a mechanism for regulating BRCA1 expression.To asses in an in vitro model of breast cancer the miRNA-target interaction and its effect on BRCA1, expression levels of ID4 and miR-342 were measured in five human breast cancer cell lines including MDA-MB-231 and BT20 (ER-negative), HCC1937 (BRCA1-mutant, ER-negative) [26], MCF7 and T47D (ER-positive). As shown in Figure 6A, an inverse correlation of ID4 and the miRNA was observed; in particular ID4 gene expression was higher in the ER-negative cell lines. By contrast, miR-342 had higher expression in ER-positive cells. This was in accordance with literature data that report both ID4 and miR-342 expression associated with the ER status of human breast cancer cells [13], [24], [27].10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g006Figure 6Down-regulation of ID4 protein through miR-342 increases BRCA1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells.(A) Expression of ID4 (left) and miR-342 (right) measured by qRT-PCR in five breast cancer cell lines.

(C) Western blotting analysis of ID4 and BRCA1 proteins on the same cells. qRT-PCR data are expressed as two elevated to \xE2\x80\x93\xCE\x94Ct (delta cycle threshold) value which is directly related to the expression levels. \xCE\xB2-Actin and Vinculin were used as loading control.Among the five cell lines analyzed for ID4 and miR-342 expression, we selected MDA-MB-231(ER-negative), HCC1937 (BRCA1-mutant and ER-negative) and MCF7 (ER-positive) cells and transfected them with miR-342 precursor molecule, or with a scramble oligonucleotide, to assess the expression modulation of ID4 and BRCA1 proteins through Western blotting analysis. Overexpression of miR-342, verified in all the three cell lines by qRT-PCR (Figure 6B), led to a reduction of 60% of ID4 protein and to an increase of about 50% of BRCA1 protein in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to cells transfected with a scramble oligonucleotide (Figure 6C) thus confirming that miR-342 can indirectly modulate BRCA1 expression. Reduction of ID4 protein (about 50%) was observed also in HCC1937 cells, which carry both the BRCA1 truncated alleles, but it was not associated with increase of BRCA1 protein. In the MCF7 cells the weak reduction of ID4 protein observed (about 20%) did not lead to an increase of BRCA1 protein (Figure 6C).MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with a pool of four oligonucleotides targeting different portions of ID4 (siRNA ID4) that silenced ID4 expression showed increased expression of BRCA1 that was similar to that observed after miR-342 overexpression; this effect was stronger when cells were cotransfected with siRNA ID4 and miR-342 (Figure 7).10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g007Figure 7Silencing of ID4 in MDA-MB-231 cells.Transfection of siRNA ID4 and pre-miR-342 or of a scramble oligonucleotide in MDA-MB-231 cells: (A) qRT-PCR evaluation of miR-342 expression. (B) Western blotting analysis of ID4 and BRCA1 proteins; \xCE\xB1-Tubulin and Vinculin were used as loading control. The figure illustrates one representative experiment and shows the quantified protein expression of BRCA1 normalized to Vinculin. qRT-PCR data are expressed as two elevated to \xE2\x80\x93\xCE\x94Ct (delta cycle threshold) value which is directly related to the expression levels.Associated Expression of miR-342 and BRCA1 in Estrogen Receptor Negative SamplesWe investigated if the interaction between miR-342 and ID4 resulting in BRCA1 modulation validated in vitro could be also observed in the clinical samples included in our case series. To this aim, we assessed if the association of ID4 and miR-342 with BRCA1 was independent from ESR1, PGR and ERBB2. We fitted a multivariable linear regression model in which the BRCA1 gene expression was modelled as a function of ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1 and miR-342; an interaction between ER status and miR-342 expression was also included (adjusted analysis) while the other interaction terms were not statistically significant and were not included. The results were also compared to those obtained using models with only one covariate included (univariariate analysis) as graphically presented in Figure 8. After adjusting the analysis for all the other variables included in the model, statistically there was no significant association between BRCA1 and ID4 (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.60) or PGR (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.16), while an association between BRCA1 and ERBB2 was observed (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.007). The expression of BRCA1 and ESR1 was significantly and positively associated in the group of the ER-positive samples (P<0.001), but not in the group of the ER-negative samples (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.21), even though, on average, the ER-negative and ER-positive samples had similar BRCA1 expression. miR-342 was positively associated to the BRCA1 gene within the subset of ER-negative patients (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.02), while the association was not statistically significant for ER-positive patients (P\xE2\x80\x8A=\xE2\x80\x8A0.26). This finding suggests the existence of a mechanism different from ER status that regulates BRCA1 expression in ER-negative samples that could be operated through expression of miR-342.10.1371/journal.pone.0087039.g008Figure 8Estimated association between BRCA1 and ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1 and miR-342.The associations were estimated from regression models where BRCA1 was the outcome (y-axis) while the other genes (ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1) and miR-342 were the covariates (x-axis). In the multivariate model (adjusted analysis, showed in solid lines) all the covariates and the interaction terms between ER status and miR-342 were included. The univariate models (showed in dashed lines) included only the specified gene (ID4, PGR, ERBB2, ESR1) or miR-342 as covariates. The analysis of the association of BRCA1 with ER and miR-342 was done dividing patients according to their ER status.Estimating the same model with the TCGA data set we found that ID4 remained statistically significantly associated to BRCA1 in the analysis adjusted for all the other variables (P<0.001), while the positive association between ESR1 and BRCA1 within the ER-positive patients, observed in the univariable analysis, was not statistically significant in the adjusted analysis. The positive association between miR-342 and BRCA1 within the ER-negative patients, observed in the model based on our data, was not confirmed on the TCGA data set (see Figure S6 for complete results).DiscussionIn this study we demonstrated in vitro that a mechanism involving the microRNA miR-342 and the two genes ID4 and BRCA1, which are frequently altered in breast cancer, could have a role in the pathogenesis of this tumor type. We showed in the ER-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 that miR-342 indirectly controls the expression of BRCA1 gene through direct regulation of ID4. This result was supported by the finding that, using a siRNA based strategy to reduce ID4 expression, we observed increased expression of BRCA1, comparable to that found with miR-342 transfection.miR-342 is expressed in several cancers including leukemia [28], breast and colorectal cancer, where it exerts a tumor suppressor function that is operated through induction of apoptosis [29], [30]. In breast cancer, expression of miR-342 has been associated with better prognosis [15], [31]. This finding is supported by the observation that miR-342 is highly expressed in ER-positive tumors, in particular in the luminal molecular subclass of breast cancers [13], [14] characterized by better prognosis, and that its expression is directly correlated with the expression levels of the estrogen receptor [14], [32], [33]. In addition, miR-342 is down-regulated in breast tumors resistant to Tamoxifen, a selective ER modulator commonly used for treating ER-positive breast cancers. Reintroduction of miR-342 sensitizes refractory breast tumor cells to tamoxifen therapy, suggesting that miR-342 is an important regulator of tamoxifen response [34], [35]. In our cohort of breast cancer cases and in five breast cancer cell lines, as well as in an independent in silico data set of 283 breast cancer retrieved from TCGA [22], we confirmed the strong positive association between miR-342 expression and ER status, as miR-342 was more highly expressed in ER-positive than in ER-negative cases and cell lines. In order to identify the genes controlled by miR-342 that could be involved in breast cancer, thus underlining the role of miR-342 in this tumor type, we used a computational approach for predicting miRNA target transcripts and identified ID4 as a putative target of miR-342 in all the three databases of miRNA target prediction we investigated. ID4 is a member of the ID (inhibitor of DNA binding) family of the helix-loop-helix-transcription factors (HLH) that do not possess a DNA binding domain. ID proteins function as dominant-negative regulators of basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors through the formation of inactive heterodimers [36]. The four members of the ID proteins family (ID-1 to 4) are regulators of crucial cellular processes. Increased expression of ID proteins has been reported in several cancer types [37], [38], [39] and has been found associated with loss of differentiation, enhanced malignancy and aggressive clinical behavior [36], [40]. ID4 is involved in mammalian embryogenesis, angiogenesis and in the maintenance of cancer stem cells [41], [42], [43]. In breast cancer, ID4 expression is quite controversial; in fact, it was found in normal breast epithelium, and, while it was not detected in ER-positive tumors or neoplastic lesions [24], it was present in ER-negative tumors [27]. Beger and colleagues showed that an increase in ID4 expression was associated with the ability of breast cancer cells to exhibit anchorage-independent growth, while its depletion determined their morphological change to large and flat epithelial phenotypes [25]. The finding that ID4 is a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 [25], [27], [44] supports an oncogenic function of ID4. Germline mutations of BRCA1 predispose to breast cancer and are characteristic of the hereditary form of this tumor [6]. Somatic mutations in this gene are very rare in the sporadic form, while decreased expression levels of BRCA1 have been identified in the triple negative group, or basal-like subtype, of sporadic breast cancers (ER, PR and HER2 negative) that have genetic profiles similar to BRCA1 mutation carrier tumors [44] and express high levels of ID4 [45]. We confirmed that ID4 expression is inversely correlated to ER levels and observed an inverse correlation between ID4 and expression of miR-342 in our cohort of cases, in the independent data set and in the breast cancer cell lines we analyzed, which supported the interaction between miR-342 and ID4 predicted in silico. Finally, our in vitro experiments conduct
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: ed using Luciferase assays, functionally confirmed that ID4 is a direct target of miR-342. This miRNA could therefore be involved in the modulation of ID4 in breast cancer. When we evaluated mRNA levels of ID4 and BRCA1 in our cohort of cases and in the validation set, we observed a negative association of their expression that suggested a role for the possible interaction of the two genes in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, possibly through miR-342 mediated regulation of ID4 that modulates BRCA1. microRNA operated regulation of BRCA1 has already been reported in another study where miR-335 was shown to target four different modulators of BRCA1 expression, including ID4 [46]. However, interaction of ID4 with miR-335 was very weak compared with that of the other BRCA1 modulators (ER\xCE\xB1, IGF1R and SP1) and no reduction of Luciferase activity was shown with the ID4 construct. Most likely, the effect of miR-335 on BRCA1 expression was operated through the other three targets. Our study shows that miR-342 directly binds ID4, as demonstrated by the Luciferase reporter assay, and the BRCA1 modulation we observed in the cellular model was actually provoked by the reduction of ID4 as ER\xCE\xB1, IGF1R and SP1 are not predicted targets of miR-342. Wen et al. found that triple negative breast cancers present high levels of ID4 protein respect to the other breast cancers and propose that overexpression of ID4 could functionally inactivate BRCA1 in this tumor type which presents characteristics similar to BRCA1-mutant tumors and downregulation of BRCA1 [45]. In the case series we analyzed, we observed a correlation between miR-342 and BRCA1 expression for the ER-negative cases that were mostly also PGR- and ERBB2- negative. However, the fact that most of them were also BRCA1-mutant cases has so far prevented us to demonstrate a direct link between cancer and reduced expression of the gene. The correlation between miR-342 and BRCA1 was not confirmed in the independent data set, where the ER-negative series also included non PGR- and ERBB2-negative cases. However, the fact that the inverse correlation between ID4 and miR-342 and ID4 and BRCA1 remained statistically significant highlights that the interplay between the miRNA and the two genes could exist. On the other hand, we successfully demonstrated the interplay between miR-342 and the two genes in MDA-MB-231 cells that share the features of the clinical \xE2\x80\x9Ctriple negative\xE2\x80\x9D tumor type for their ER, PR and HER2 negative status, and have been classified in the basal B subtype based on their transcriptional profile [47], [48]. The reason why we chose this triple negative cell line was that it expressed high levels of ID4 compared with the other triple negative cell lines analyzed. Moreover, because of its endogenous low expression of miR-342, it represented a good model where to do the overexpression of miR-342 and to study its effects on ID4 and BRCA1 interaction. To support our hypothesis, overexpression of miR-342 in MCF7 cells, that are ER-positive and present high levels of miR-342 and BRCA1 but low ID4 expression, only resulted in a weak reduction of ID4 that has no effects on BRCA1 expression. We also evaluated changes in the expression of ID4 and BRCA1 in the BRCA1-mutant cell line HCC1937 and found that transfection of miR-342 strongly reduced ID4, but not BRCA1 expression. However in these cells ID4 and miR-342 are expressed at lower levels than in MDA-MB-231 that perhaps are not enough for activating the mechanism of BRCA1 modulation operated by ID4.The fact that the cohort of patients we analyzed also included heredo-familial cases prevented us from observing a direct effect of miR-342 on BRCA1 activity since most of the ER-negative cases analyzed were BRCA1-mutant. However, these samples had higher expression of ID4 and lower expression of BRCA1 compared to sporadic and BRCA2-mutant cases, and the same correlation for BRCA1 and ID4 was observed for the BRCAx group. This observation suggests that at least part of the familial predisposition to breast cancer of the heterogeneous BRCAx group could be explained by a regulatory effect of ID4 on BRCA1, possibly involving miR-342. However, we can only speculate that miR-342 has a role in the reduced expression of BRCA1, since all the BRCAx cases we analyzed where ER-positive (and this miRNA is lower in an ER-negative context). To validate this hypothesis, measurement of expression levels of miR-342, ID4 and BRCA1 and the assessment of their correlation should be extended to a larger cohort of BRCAx samples including ER-negative cases. Results from larger investigations could clarify if miR-342 can be considered an additional player in the genetic predisposition to breast cancer.Supporting InformationFigure S1Association of individual miRNA expression differences between samples and ER, PR and HER2 status.

For the five to ten percent of women who have a strong inherited predisposition to breast cancer [1], more aggressive prevention strategies\xE2\x80\x94such as chemoprevention or prophylactic mastectomy/oophorectomy\xE2\x80\x94may be recommended\xC2\xA0in addition to or instead of surveillance. However, many women with a family history of breast cancer, including many who carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, never develop breast cancer. Indeed, 40-50\xC2\xA0% of women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation do not develop breast cancer by 70\xC2\xA0years of age [2]. This situation leads to uncertainty for both patient and physician regarding whether to pursue these aggressive prevention strategies, which can cause health and lifestyle effects that many women consider to be severe. For example, side effects of chemoprevention can include osteoporosis, blood clots, endometrial cancer, hot flushes, joint pain, and depression [3, 4]. Thus there is a critical need to accurately differentiate individuals from high-risk families who will develop breast cancer from those who will not develop breast cancer. Screening and prevention resources could then be focused on those women who carry the highest risk for familial breast cancer (FBC), while women with a lower risk could be spared the risks and inconveniences of prophylaxis or intensive screening. Optimally, such an approach would be non-invasive and provide estimates of risk that are tailored to each individual.One existing method for estimating breast-cancer risk is based on personal health history, family health history, and demographic variables [5]; however, this approach is designed as a population-wide screening tool\xE2\x80\x94not specifically for individuals from high-risk families\xE2\x80\x94and the predictive accuracy of this method is limited [6]. Others have examined the potential to predict breast-cancer risk based on genetic or epigenetic variation, and these approaches have improved prediction accuracy [7\xE2\x80\x939]. We evaluated an alternative approach, hypothesizing that by quantifying gene-expression activity in peripheral-blood cells, we would be able to identify patterns that indicate a woman\xE2\x80\x99s risk for developing breast cancer, as gene-expression profiling of normal cells has previously provided information about disease development [10\xE2\x80\x9313]. This approach aims to overcome limitations of using genetic variants to predict risk. For example, due to genetic heterogeneity, individuals who develop breast cancer differ considerably in the risk variants that they carry, and most such variants are believed to have a subtle effect on risk. Gene-expression levels reflect biological activity within cells and serve as proxies for genetic (and epigenetic) variation within normal cells as well as tumor cells [10, 14, 15]. Indeed, it has been shown that global expression levels in lymphoblastoid cells reflect a person\xE2\x80\x99s BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation status, even when the mutations lie at different genomic loci within these genes [16]. Aberrant expression resulting from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may not be reflected phenotypically in peripheral-blood cells; however expression levels in these cells may indicate a propensity for normal cellular activity within breast cells to become disrupted. Gene-expression levels in breast tumors have been shown to reflect functional germline variation. For example, expression patterns in tumors from patients with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants exhibit distinctive patterns compared to tumors from individuals who do not carry these mutations [14\xE2\x80\x9326]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that gene-expression-levels in normal cells should be similar across many women who develop FBC and thus indicative of disease risk, even though the underlying genetic and epigenetic variation may vary considerably across these women.For this study, we examined the potential to use peripheral-blood gene-expression levels to identify women who possess the highest risk for developing FBC. We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for two independent patient cohorts and evaluated how well this gene-expression data could be used to differentiate between women who have developed FBC and women who have not, independent of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status. Our findings indicate that this approach has potential to provide women from breast cancer families with individualized estimates of breast cancer risk and therefore to guide patient decisions regarding medical management.MethodsDescription of patient cohorts and data sets and consent to publishUtahWe recruited participants via the High Risk Breast Cancer Clinic at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (Utah, USA) under Institutional Review Board approved protocols (#00022886 and #00004965). We have obtained consent from these patients to report individual patient data. We collected blood samples after breast cancer occurrence and after participants had been in remission for at least six months. In general, we considered participants to have a family history of breast cancer if two or more first-degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter) had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Among eligible participants who met these criteria, we included all those from whom we could obtain fresh mononuclear cells at the time of the study. Among 83 individuals in the Utah cohort who had a family history of breast cancer, 39 had been diagnosed with breast cancer, whereas 44 women had never been diagnosed with breast cancer and were at least 55\xC2\xA0years of age (Table\xC2\xA01). Of the participants with a breast cancer family history, 38 carried a known pathogenic mutation (identified via commercial testing) in BRCA1 or BRCA2. We excluded women who carried a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation but lacked a family history of breast cancer. To ensure that our findings were specific to familial breast cancer, we recruited 41 individuals with no known family history of breast cancer; 22 of these women had developed sporadic (non-familial) breast cancer. We matched the patients by age. The median age of blood draw was consistent across all patient subgroups in the Utah cohort (Table\xC2\xA02). We used an analysis-of-variance test to ensure that the difference in age across the subgroups was not statistically significant (p\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.064). In addition, because our goal was to demonstrate an ability to differentiate between individuals who developed familial breast cancer and individuals who did not, we also verified that there was not a significant difference in ages between these two groups (t-test p-value\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.28).Table 1Summary of patient subgroups in the Utah and Ontario populationsCategoryUtahOntarioFamily history, BRCA1/2, Cancer1611Family history, BRCAX, Cancer2317Family history, BRCA1/2, No Cancer1814Family history, BRCAX, No Cancer2618No family history, Cancer228No family history, No Cancer195Total12473Patients fell into one of six groups, depending on whether 1) they had a family history of breast cancer, 2) had been diagnosed with breast cancer previously, or 3) were known to carry a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

These data represent 117 participants from the Utah cohort. The remaining 8 Utah participants were at least 55\xC2\xA0years old; however, it was not feasible to collect their exact ages in retrospect. The median age at which blood samples were acquired was consistent across the groups (p\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.064)OntarioWe obtained de-identified samples via the Ontario, Canada site of the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR). We also obtained consent from these patients to report individual patient data. This cohort included 28 samples from women with a family history of breast cancer who had developed breast cancer, 32 from women who had a family history of breast cancer but had not developed breast cancer, and 13 from women with no family history of breast cancer, 8 of whom had developed breast cancer. Of these 73 women, approximately half were post-menopausal. We obtained, isolated, and stored blood samples for these women when they first enrolled in the BCFR.Genomic data acquisition and depositionWe used the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to isolate PBMCs from whole blood in cell-preparation tubes following manufacturer (Becton-Dickinson) protocol. Within two hours, we extracted RNA using the RiboPure RNA Isolation Kit, and hybridized the RNA to Affymetrix Genechip Human Exon 1.0 ST microarrays. Hybridization and scanning were performed at Duke University (for Utah samples and for half of the Ontario samples) and at Boston University School of Medicine (for the remaining Ontario samples).Microarray data normalizationTo correct for array- and probe-level background noise, we applied our Single-channel Array Normalization algorithm [27] to the Affymetrix microarray data. We subsequently used the PLANdbAffy database [28] to limit our analysis to microarray probes that were classified as high quality (\\\"green\\\") and that did not map to a single-nucleotide variant. For each microarray, we summarized the remaining 2,201,005 probes into gene-level values using a 10\xC2\xA0% trimmed mean. In addition, we excluded genes that contained fewer than five probes.Because the microarrays had been processed at different facilities and a

We used cohort and processing facility to define the batches. We applied ComBat two separate times: 1) to the Utah samples and Ontario samples that were processed at Duke University and 2) to the same Utah samples (processed at Duke University) and to the Ontario samples that were processed at Boston University. Strong batch effects existed before adjustment, but after ComBat adjustment, no clear pattern remained between batches and gene-expression levels (Additional file 1: Figure S1). We have deposited the raw and processed data files in Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE47862).Gene-expression data filteringTo identify blood markers that could influence mRNA expression but that may cause confounding effects, we used a total lymphocyte enumeration test to evaluate the blood cells. This test provided total counts of CD4-positive T cells, CD8-positive T-cells, CD3-positive T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells. These counts were available for 22 samples from the Utah cohort. Furthermore, we obtained epidemiological and demographic data via a health-assessment survey for 63 patients from the Utah cohort. The health survey variables we collected were age, education level, marital status, religious preference, health status, physical activity, age at menarche, contraceptive use, total number of pregnancies, total number of live births, age at first live birth, age at last live birth, breastfeeding status, time since last menstrual period, age of menopause, chemopreventive drug use (selective estrogen receptor modulators), alcohol use, tobacco use, occupational history, immunological disorder history, hypertension drug use, and anti-inflammatory drug use. Additional files 2, 3 and 4 list these values. Additional file 5 indicates cancer, family-history, and BRCA1/2 status for these patients. Using a multifactor analysis of covariance model, we excluded genes whose expression patterns correlated with any of these variables at a 0.01 significance level. Additional file 6 indicates which genes were excluded.Evaluation of normal breast cell expressionWe downloaded data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE17072), which had been produced by Lim, et al. [30]. These data contained gene-expression levels for normal breast cells\xE2\x80\x94acquired via prophylactic mastectomy or reduction mammoplasty\xE2\x80\x94for women who had a strong family history of breast cancer and for controls, respectively. Then using the top 250 genes that were expressed more highly (according to average fold change rank) in our PBMC cells from women who had developed FBC, we used the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis analytical technique [31] to assess whether these genes were up-regulated in the Lim, et al. samples. For this tool, we used default settings, except that we did not collapse genes, and we used gene-based permutation to estimate significance.SoftwareTo identify genes whose expression differed most between FBC patients and controls, we used the Support Vector Machines-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm. We used the SVMAttributeEval module within the Weka software package [32] and configured the algorithm to remove 10\xC2\xA0% of genes in each iteration.We used the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification algorithm to predict whether each participant had or had not developed FBC. To facilitate this analysis, we used the e1071 R package (http://cran.r-project.org/package=e1071) and the LIBSVM library [33]. We used the radial-basis-function SVM kernel and tuned the \xE2\x80\x9CC\xE2\x80\x9D parameter via nested cross validation. Additionally, we used the ML-Flex software package [34] to execute the analysis on a high-performance computing cluster.To plot receiver operating characteristic curves, we used the ROCR package [35]. We used a bootstrapping procedure (10,000 iterations) to calculate 95\xC2\xA0% confidence intervals [36].Software scripts used for this study are available from https://github.com/srp33/BCSP.ResultsMultigene predictions perform well for both a Utah cohort and an external validation cohort from OntarioWe filtered the genome-wide PBMC gene-expression data by identifying genes whose expression best differentiated individuals who developed FBC from controls (see Methods). Controls were of three types: individuals with a family history of breast cancer who themselves did not develop breast cancer by age 55 or greater; individuals with no family history of breast cancer who also did not develop breast cancer; and individuals with no family history of breast cancer who did develop (sporadic) breast cancer. We then used expression values for those genes to predict FBC status for each individual using the SVM algorithm [37]. Two cohorts of samples were used for this study: a cohort from Utah and an independent cohort from Ontario; both included high-risk unaffected and affected women (see Methods for cohort details). Initially, we evaluated this approach in the Utah cohort via ten-fold cross validation. Our gene expression-based estimates of FBC development were consistently higher for women from FBC families who had developed cancer than for any subset of controls (Fig.\xC2\xA01a), attaining an AUC value of 0.76 (95\xC2\xA0% CI\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.67-0.85). Similar levels of accuracy were attained for women who carried a BRCA1/2 mutation as for women with a family history of breast cancer but with no known BRCA1/2 mutation (termed BRCAX) (Fig.\xC2\xA01a; Additional file 1: Table S1). Even at the lower confidence bounds, these AUC values are competitive with results observed in previous studies that used alternative approaches [7\xE2\x80\x939]. To further evaluate this result, we randomly permuted the class labels and observed that the biomarker\xE2\x80\x99s accuracy was highly significant (p\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.001). We also repeated cross-validation 1,000 times on the Utah data and observed that on average the best prediction results were attained using 250 genes; however accuracy was consistently high, independent of gene number (Fig.\xC2\xA02).Fig. 1Predictions of familial breast cancer status in two independent cohorts. a In a cross-validated design, we predicted familial breast cancer status for 124 women from Utah. This cohort included women who did or did not have a family history (FH) of breast cancer, who did or did not carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (BRCAX if not), and who had or had not developed breast cancer. The \xE2\x80\x9CGenomic model score\xE2\x80\x9D values represent probabilistic predictions made by the support vector machines algorithm. Higher values indicate a higher probability that a given individual had developed familial breast cancer. These scores were much higher for individuals who had a family history of breast cancer and developed a breast tumor, irrespective of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status. b In a training/testing design, we predicted whether individuals in the independent Ontario cohort had developed familial breast cancer. The support vector machines algorithm was trained on the full Utah data set. Again, the scores were considerably higher for women with a family history of breast cancer who had developed a breast tumorFig. 2Cross-validation performance of gene-expression biomarker with different quantities of genes. For the gene-expression biomarker, we used the SVM-RFE method to identify genes whose expression differed most consistently between individuals who developed familial breast cancer and individuals who did not. The sizes of these gene subsets ranged in size between 25 and 300 genes. In repeated cross-validation (1,000 iterations), predictive accuracy peaked at 250 genes and was consistent when the number of genes was 150 or higherTo test whether this biomarker approach could be applied more generally via external validation, we derived an SVM model from the full Utah data set alone, and then used this model to predict FBC development in the external and independent Ontario data set. In accordance with Institute of Medicine recommendations [38], model derivation was performed solely on the Utah data before it was tested on the Ontario samples. These predictions attained an AUC of 0.73 (95\xC2\xA0% CI\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.59-0.86; permutation p-value\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.002), showing a consistently high level of accuracy between the cohorts (Figs.\xC2\xA01 and 3; Additional file 1: Table S2).Fig. 3Sensitivity and specificity of biomarker predictions. Because the support vector machines predictions (genomic model score) are probabilistic, we evaluated various cutoff thresholds at which patients could be considered to have had a \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D probability of developing familial breast cancer. a-b Receiver operating characteristic curves illustrate the balance between sensitivity and specificity across many probability thresholds for the Utah and Ontario cohorts. c-d As the genomic model scores increase, a larger proportion of patients who fell above the threshold would have been predicted accurately to develop familial breast cancer. As the threshold approaches its maximum, the predictive accuracy for patients above the threshold is nearly perfect; however, such high thresholds would result in low sensitivity levels. A threshold near 0.2 may be optimal. Panel C represents predictions for Utah participants who had a family history of breast cancer; Panel D represents the Ontario cohort. The dashed lines represent predictions for individuals who carried a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. The dotted lines represent predictions for BRCAX individuals.

2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: ndividuals who developed breast cancer. To alleviate the concern that gene-expression changes in women who developed FBC were caused by lingering treatment effects, we also collected PBMC samples for women who had developed sporadic (non-familial) breast cancer and had received treatment. In our initial analysis, we grouped these women with the participants who had no history of breast cancer and broadly classified this group as \xE2\x80\x9Ccontrols\xE2\x80\x9D. To further assess whether the predictive gene-expression patterns we identified are specific to women who develop FBC and thus have potential to predict disease risk, we assessed how well the SVM algorithm could distinguish between individuals who developed FBC and those who developed a sporadic tumor. This comparison was identical to the initial assessment, except that the control group excluded individuals who did not develop breast cancer. In this setting, the predictions attained similar levels of accuracy (Utah AUC\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.77 [0.64-0.88]; Ontario AUC\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.69 [0.49-0.89]) as the initial analysis, although the confidence intervals were wider due to the smaller sample sizes. These findings indicate that PBMC gene-expression patterns may be useful to predict FBC risk.In addition, we tested whether similar genes were dysregulated in our predictive model if the sporadics-only control group was included or not. The SVM-RFE algorithm ranks each gene according to how strongly the gene-expression values differ between the patient groups. We found that the rankings were highly similar (Spearman's rank correlation rho statistic\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.43), whether the control group contained sporadic patients only or the full control set. This finding suggests that individuals who develop familial breast cancer exhibit different gene-expression patterns than individuals who do not develop familial breast cancer, even when compared solely against individuals who had received prior diagnosis/treatments.To affirm that the expression differences in the FBC women were not confounded by treatment with estrogen receptor pathway inhibitors, we independently evaluated a publicly available data set that profiled PBMC gene-expression levels for post-menopausal women who had or had not been treated with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, respectively (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE12517). We applied the Support Vector Machines algorithm to rank the genes according to differences in expression between women who had received a given treatment and post-menopausal women who had not received either treatment. We compared these gene rankings from this study to the original analysis that compared women who had developed familial breast cancer against controls. The gene rankings were not correlated for either treatment (Spearman\xE2\x80\x99s rho for taxomifen\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.030, aromatase inhibitors\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.029). This result suggests that the genes perturbed by hormone treatments are different from those that discriminate between women who develop familial breast cancer and those who do not.Evaluating the balance between sensitivity and specificity of predictionsThe SVM prediction scores are probabilistic values ranging between zero and one. Higher values suggest a relatively high risk of familial breast cancer, and lower values suggest a relatively low risk. In clinical settings, it is often desirable to identify a single cutoff threshold above which individuals are considered to have \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D risk. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to confirm that the sensitivity and specificity of our predictions remain strong across a broad range of thresholds (Fig.\xC2\xA03a-b). Then to identify a single threshold that may be best in clinical settings, we plotted the proportion of patients who were predicted to have \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D risk and who actually developed FBC, against a range of thresholds (Fig.\xC2\xA03c-d). As expected, this value increased as the threshold increased. Accordingly, at higher thresholds, a large proportion of patients predicted to have \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D risk would received accurate predictions. However, a tradeoff would be lower sensitivity (fewer individuals who actually developed FBC would be predicted to carry a high risk). Visual inspection of Fig.\xC2\xA03c-d suggests that a cutoff threshold near 0.2 may be optimal because the slope begins to level off (or drop temporarily). If a threshold of 0.2 were used to identify individuals at the highest risk of breast cancer in the Ontario cohort, the sensitivity would be 0.68 and the specificity would be 0.71, equating to a positive likelihood ratio of 2.35 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.45. Put another way, for a woman with a 50\xC2\xA0% chance of breast cancer based on family history and BRCA status, a prediction greater than 0.2 would suggest a 70\xC2\xA0% chance of developing breast cancer, and a score less than 0.2 would indicate a 31\xC2\xA0% chance of developing breast cancer.Biological interpretationInterestingly, many genes\xE2\x80\x94for example, DSC1, FN1, ST6GALNAC5, TP63, SHB, and WNT3\xE2\x80\x94used in the above biomarker are known to play important roles in regulating cell\xE2\x80\x93cell adhesion and cell\xE2\x80\x93ECM interactions (see Additional files 7 and 8 for complete lists). To evaluate these genes at the biological pathway level, we applied the GATHER algorithm [39] to the 250 genes that best distinguished affected FBC women from controls in the Utah and Ontario data (Additional files 9 and 10); this approach indicated a significant association between FBC development and pathways that play a role in cell adhesion, including KEGG Adherens Junctions and Extracellular Matrix-receptor Interaction (p-values\xE2\x80\x89<\xE2\x80\x890.05, Table\xC2\xA03). This finding suggests that these pathways may be fundamentally dysregulated in multiple cell types, potentially including asymptomatic breast tissue, which may be a mechanism that leads to increased risk of familial breast cancer. To assess whether the gene-expression patterns associated with FBC status in our PBMC samples also occur in normal breast cells, we examined publicly available data from Lim et al. [30] and found that patients with a strong family history of breast cancer have significantly higher overall expression (p\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.001, see Methods) for genes that were overexpressed in our FBC samples.Table 3Top pathway results from GATHER analysisTerm IDTerm\\np-valuehsa04520Adherens junction0.00149hsa00590Prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolism0.00775hsa04350TGF-beta signaling pathway0.0132hsa04510Focal adhesion0.014For genes that exhibited consistent fold-change directions in the Utah and Ontario gene-expression data (Additional files 7 and 8), we sorted the genes by average rank of fold change and t-test p-values. The 250 top-ranked genes were used to query GATHER [39] for KEGG pathways most strongly associated with this gene list. Pathways that attained a p-value less than 0.05 are shownDiscussionWomen from FBC families face greater uncertainty regarding their personal risk of breast cancer than the general population [40]. Accurate risk prediction is important in part because 54\xC2\xA0% of high-risk women fail to follow appropriate screening procedures for breast-cancer prevention, even when they have health insurance, receive reminders, and have a positive attitude toward screening [41]; however, increased perceived risk translates into increased willingness to consider effective prevention strategies such as tamoxifen [42]. Various risk-prediction models based on clinical and/or genomic data have been proposed, yet the discriminatory accuracy of these models has been modest (AUC 0.56-0.70) [6\xE2\x80\x939, 43]. Multiple studies have shown that higher accuracy levels can be obtained using gene-expression profiles of peripheral blood cells in the context of early detection [44, 45]. However, these studies have focused on general breast-cancer risk, and their approaches were tested in single cohorts. Our goal was to develop a classification approach specific to women from high-risk families\xE2\x80\x94based on PBMC gene expression\xE2\x80\x94and to validate this approach in an external cohort consisting of women from a different geographical location.Researchers have placed much emphasis on identifying additional susceptibility variants [46]; however, known susceptibility variants account for at most ~30\xC2\xA0% of familial breast cancer risk [47], and common variants currently show only moderate predictive capabilities for risk [8]. Here, we identify expression-based changes reflective of a person's risk to develop breast cancer. We emphasize the importance of additional, prospective studies with larger sample sizes to further evaluate the clinical potential of our approach (and alternative approaches); however, the confidence intervals for our results demonstrate that our sample size was large enough to obtain statistically meaningful results. Furthermore, previous studies that have used transcriptomic predictors for prognostic and diagnostic purposes have been deemed informative using similar or smaller cohort sizes [44, 45, 48].We propose that additional approaches could be used to inform women about their personal breast cancer risk. In this study, we identified multigene expression patterns in peripheral blood cells that differ between individuals who have developed familial breast cancer and those who have not. Importantly, the peripheral-blood expression patterns were predictive of familial breast cancer, independent of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status. In addition, our approach distinguished between individuals who developed familial breast cancer and those who developed sporadic breast cancer, suggesting that our approach\xE2\x80\x99s predictive ability was

[49]. Additional studies are critical to prospectively evaluate the risk-predictive utility of our approach in different clinical settings.ConclusionOur approach has the possibility to alter how women with a family history of breast cancer make decisions regarding their health. Indeed, the risk-estimation approach we present here has the ability to provide a risk assessment for each individual woman. For example, each woman within a given family or multiple women who carry a known susceptibility variant could be assigned different individual risks based on their gene-expression profile, leading to more personalized prevention decisions. These risk assessments could provide reassurance for women who are not as highly predisposed and thus may opt for monitoring and/or chemoprevention rather than prophylactic mastectomy. Alternatively, a high predicted risk could provide evidence to support prophylactic surgeries or chemopreventive intervention.Further studies will be needed to develop multi-data risk models that incorporate gene-expression based models with other informative data such as family history, clinical and demographic characteristics, and germline variants. Additionally, it will be helpful in the future to evaluate whether our findings generalize to women who have only one known first-degree relative with breast cancer (in this study, we focused on women with multiple affected first-degree relatives). However, the accuracy of our results indicates that gene expression based biomarkers hold promise for assessing individual breast cancer risk in a minimally invasive manner and that they can be applied broadly to women from high-risk families.Ethical approvalThe institutional/ethical review boards at the University of Utah and Mount Sinai Hospital approved collection and dissemination of data for this study.\",\"id\":\"2f0be48f-252f-4a5c-8432-af4150c168a5\",\"_version_\":1534952897796636672},{\"nlmTa\":\"PLoS One\",\"all\":[\"PLoS One\",\"PLoS ONE\",\"PLoS ONE\",\"2012-6-11\",\"Public Library of Science\",\"San Francisco, USA\",\"22701724\",\"3372467\",\"Deregulated miRNAs in Hereditary Breast Cancer Revealed a Role for miR-30c in Regulating KRAS Oncogene\",\"7\",\"6\"],\"isoAbbrev\":\"PLoS ONE\",\"journalTitle\":\"PLoS ONE\",\"epub\":\"2012-6-11\",\"publisherName\":\"Public Library of Science\",\"publisherLoc\":\"San Francisco, USA\",\"pmid\":22701724,\"pmc\":3372467,\"articleTitle\":\"Deregulated miRNAs in Hereditary Breast Cancer Revealed a Role for miR-30c in Regulating KRAS Oncogene\",\"volume\":7,\"issue\":6,\"body\":\"IntroductionBreast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in developed countries. The majority of breast cancers are sporadic, while familial breast cancer comprises 5\xE2\x80\x9310% of all breast cancers. Germline mutations in the currently known high risk-breast cancer genes (such as BRCA1/2) are common in familial breast cancer, but they can explain, at best, 20\xE2\x80\x9325% of the overall excess familial risk. [1]. Still, the large majority of breast cancer cases that arise in families with strong familial aggregation are not explained by mutations in any know breast cancer susceptibility gene, and are designated as BRCAX-type tumors [2].In the past decade, gene expression profiling by microarray analysis has lead to great advances in classification of human breast tumors, and the identification of five reproducible molecular subtypes of breast cancer, that have distinct biological features, clinical outcomes, and responses to chemotherapy [3]. On the other hand, there have been only a handful of studies focused on familial breast cancer, due to difficulties in collecting the tumor material, demonstrating that BRCA1/2-mutated breast tumors could be distinguished from sporadic ones based on their gene expression signatures [4].Recently, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling calls a great attention to define various types of cancers [5], [6]. miRNAs are an abundant class of small \xE2\x88\xBC22 nt long single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules acting as negative regulators at post-transcriptional level by binding the 3\xE2\x80\xB2 untranslated regions (3\xE2\x80\xB2UTRs) of their mRNA-targets [7]. miRNAs are involved in crucial biological processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation [6]. Notably, miRNA deregulation has been extensively implicated in cancer pathogenesis in various tumor types [8], [9]. The observed effects of miRNA mis-expression on tumor initiation, maintenance or metastasis can be explained by the mRNA targets and pathways they regulate, which include known tumor suppressors and oncogenes [10]. Specifically, in breast cancer, various studies have identified mis-expressed miRNAs in tumours vs. normal tissue, and shown that changes in their expression seem to define, similarly to what has been found by expression profiling of coding genes, different histological (lobular/ductal, ER+/ER\xE2\x88\x92) [11], [12] and molecular (luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, HER2+) subtypes described so far [13]. In addition, integration of miRNA and mRNA data of a set of breast cancer samples allowed the association of miRNAs to relevant cellular processes, such as proliferation, cell cycle, immune response or cell adhesion, as well as with molecular characteristics of tumors like TP53 mutations [14].Still, very little is known about the role of miRNAs in familial breast cancer. The identification of target genes and pathways regulated by miRNAs would be critical to understand their function in tumor development. In this study we sought to establish miRNA expression profiles using microarray technology of familial breast cancer tumors and comparing with normal breast tissues. Interestingly, KRAS has been identified as a target oncogene for down-regulated miRNAs. Direct regulation of KRAS by miR-30c and growth inhibition by this miRNA was experimentally demonstrated. The identification of miRNAs deregulated in familial breast tumors could provide a better understanding of the biology of familial breast cancer and could indicate novel targets for therapy.ResultsmiRNA Expression Profiling in Primary Familial Breast Tumors and Normal Breast TissueIn order to establish the miRNA profile of hereditary breast tumors, we used LNA based microRNA microarrays. After initial preprocessing we had data from 1276 hsa-miRNAs (831 hsa-miR and 434 hsa-miRPlus). A filter procedure to eliminate genes with low expression variation across the experiments (SD<0.3) and with uniformly low expression, reduced the number of miRNAs to a total of 327 hsa-miRNAs (198 hsa-miR and 118 miRPlus). In an effort to detect significant differences in miRNA expression between normal breast tissue and hereditary breast tumors, we performed a differential expression analysis. We identified 19 miRNA significantly differentially expressed (FDR<0.05) between normal breast tissue and familial tumoral samples (Figure 1). Almost all differentially expressed miRNAs were found to be down-regulated in tumor tissues, with the exception of miR-21 and miR-300 that were up-regulated in breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue (Table 1). Down-regulation of selected miRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR in an independent set of tumors (Figure S1).10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g001Figure 1Differentially expressed miRNAs between normal breast tissue and hereditary breast tumors.Heat map of the expression of the 19 miRNAs differentially expressed between normal samples and tumors, overexpression in red, lower expression in green.

HMEC cells represent normal proliferating cells and normal tissue represent preferentially non proliferating cells, therefore, down regulation of some miRNAs, such as miR-99a, miR-101 or miR-145 (Figure 1), might be related to both normal and tumoral proliferation. However, down-regulation of other miRNAs, miR-205, miR-125a/b, miR-100 or miR-30c, might have a role in more specific tumoral processes.miRNAs Commonly Deregulated in Familial and Sporadic Breast CancerInterestingly, several miRNAs that we found to be deregula

Thus, 11 of the 19 miRNAs (miR-10b, -100, -101, -125a, -125b, 130a, -143, -145, -21, -205, and -30c) were previously identified in two key studies as being miss-regulated in sporadic breast tumors in comparison to normal tissue [11], [12], suggesting that these miRNAs may play a general role in breast carcinogenesis (Figure 2). Deregulation of some of these miRNAs in sporadic tumors was also confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis in an independent set of 18 sporadic breast tumors (Figure S1).10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g002Figure 2Shared differentially expressed miRNAs in sporadic breast tumors and hereditary tumors.Venn diagrams representing commonly deregulated miRNAs in two different studies carried out in sporadic breast cancer samples [11], [12] and in the present study on hereditary breast tumors. Regardless of the genetic background or histopathological features of the tumors, there are miRNAs consistently altered in breast tumor samples.Pathway Enrichment AnalysisGiven the fact that a single miRNA can target a large number of mRNA transcripts, miss-expression of a set of miRNAs could have significant effect on cellular function by affecting multiple signaling pathways. To assess the potential impact of deregulated miRNA in hereditary breast tumors on biological processes and pathways, we used Diana miRPath web-based computational tool for biological interpretation of miRNA profiling data using over-representation analysis of biological processes and signaling pathways that are targeted collectively by co-expressed miRNAs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis has revealed that the set of differentially expressed miRNAs between normal tissue and hereditary breast tumors, targets multiple effectors of pathways involved in ubiquitilation, cell proliferation and migration. Full list of pathways that have significantly overrepresented genes (p<0.05) collectively targeted by the set of 19 differentially expressed miRNAs is shown in Table 2. Observed down regulation of miRNAs in tumors regulating expression of these genes may result in abnormally activated pathways leading to increased proliferation and/or migration abilities.10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.t002Table 2Significantly enriched signaling pathways associated to the differentially expressed. miRNAs.KEGG PathwayN\xC2\xB0 of miRNA Target Genes-LN(p-value)Gene NamesUbiquitin mediated proteolysis2017.18UBE2D1, SOCS1, UBE2D2, UBE3C, UBE1, MAP3K1, BIRC6, UBE2J1, UBE2I, SMURF1, UBE2W, CBL, BTRC, WWP1, CUL2, SOCS3, CBLB, NEDD4L, NEDD4, ITCHAxon guidance1711.88SRGAP3, PLXNA2, GNAI2, DPYSL2, ITGB1, UNC5C, EFNA3, SEMA4D, EPHB2, SEMA6D, KRAS, CFL2, NRP1, PPP3CA, RASA1, SEMA3A, NFAT5Insulin signaling pathway167.96PPARGC1A, SOCS1, MAPK8, TSC1, PDPK1, KRAS, CBL, FRAP1, CRKL, SORBS1, SOS1, FOXO1, SOCS3, CBLB, PIK3CD, AKT3O-Glycan biosynthesis67.23GALNT2, GALNT7, GALNT1, GALNT3, GCNT1, B4GALT5mTOR signaling pathway75.31TSC1, PDPK1, FRAP1, ENSG00000164327, RPS6KA3, PIK3CD, AKT3ErbB signaling pathway104.74MAPK8, NRG3, KRAS, CBL, FRAP1, CRKL, SOS1, CBLB, PIK3CD, AKT3Glycan structures - biosynthesis 1124.35GALNT2, GALNT7, GALNT1, GALNT3, CHST2, STT3B, CHST1, GCNT1, EXTL2, B4GALT5, MAN1A2, XYLT1MAPK signaling pathway203.84MAP4K4, MAPK8, MAP3K1, KRAS, MEF2C, BDNF, CRKL, TAOK1, STK4, SOS1, FGFR1, RPS6KA5, FGF2, RAP1B, PPP3CA, NF1, RASA1, MAP3K12, RPS6KA3, AKT3Regulation of actin cytoskeleton173.61ITGB1, WASL, ARHGEF6, KRAS, PIP4K2B, CRKL, CFL2, PIP4K2A, ITGA6, SOS1, FGFR1, FGF2, ITGB3, GNA13, ACTC1, PIK3CD, PFN2Adherents junction83.55IGF1R, SNAI1, WASL, SMAD2, SORBS1, FGFR1, SSX2IP, PVRL1Focal adhesion163.54BCL2, MAPK8, ITGB1, IGF1R, PDPK1, CRKL, ITGA6, SOS1, PTEN,PTENP1, RAP1B, ITGB3, ARHGAP5, CCND2, PIK3CD, AKT3, CCND1T cell receptor signaling pathway93.2KRAS, CBL, SOS1, PPP3CA, CBLB, PDCD1, NFAT5, PIK3CD, AKT3We focused on the MAPK signaling pathway since a large number of genes within this pathway were found to be commonly targeted by 8 out of 19 deregulated miRNAs in our study suggesting that these miRNAs might cooperate to affect gene expression and consequentially activation or repression of signaling pathways (Table 2). Interestingly, miR-30c has potential binding sites on 20 different target genes involved in MAPK pathway (Table S1). This miRNA potentially target important mediators of MAPK signaling, such as KRAS, RASA1, MAP3K1 and MAPK8. Furthermore, KRAS gene has been previously validated as a target of several miRNAs, including let-7, miR-143 and miR-96 [15], [16], [17]. Now, we investigated whether miR-30c could be regulating KRAS expression in hereditary breast tumors. Thus, we confirmed by pRT-PCR that miR-30c had decreased expression in both hereditary and sporadic breast tumors comparing to normal samples (Figure 3). In addition, the other KRAS regulating miRNAs, let-7 and miRNA-143 were previously found to be significantly down-regulated in breast tumors [15], [16], while miR-96 regulated KRAS in pancreatic tumors [17]. Although mutations in KRAS are infrequent in breast tumors, activation of KRAS pathway in breast cancer have been frequently found. All these data suggests that deregulation of miRNAs would be a mechanism to explain KRAS overexpression in breast tumors. The role of miR-143 and miR-145 in regulating KRAS expression was already described, however it was never described miR-30c targeting KRAS.10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g003Figure 3Validation of miR-30c expression by qRT-PCR in hereditary and sporadic tumors.Expression levels of miR-30c in an independent set of 12 familial (FamBC) and 8 sporadic tumors (SpoBC) comparing to normal breast tissue expression. Differences were estimated by t-test and p values are shown for each comparison.miR-30c Regulates KRAS ExpressionWe explored the role of miR-30c in regulation of KRAS expression. A negative correlation between miR-30c expression and KRAS protein level was observed in two breast cancer cell lines (Figure 4). In addition, several bioinformatic target prediction algorithms (DIANA microT4.0, TargetScan, PITA, PicTar, miRANDA) indicated existence of a broadly conserved putative binding site for miR-30c in the 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR of the KRAS gene (Figure 5A). To test the hypothesis that KRAS is a bona fide target of miR-30c, we constructed a reporter plasmid harboring 300 pb of the wild-type 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR region of KRAS flanking miR-30c binding site downstream of the luciferase coding region. MDA-MB-436 cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter and pre-miR-30c or scramble control. As a result, pre-miR-30c transfected cells showed a marked reduction (52%) of luciferase activity compared to scramble control, confirming the interaction between miR-30c and KRAS 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR binding site (Figure 5B). Next, we checked whether miR-30c could affect KRAS mRNA stability by performing qRT-PCR analysis in MDA-MB-436 cells transiently transfected with either pre-miR-30c or scramble control. Indeed, we observed a sharp decrease in KRAS mRNA levels upon transfections with pre-miR-30c (Figure 5C).10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g004Figure 4Correlation of expression of miR-30c and KRAS in two breast cancer cell lines.Inverse correlation between the expression level of miR-30 determine by qRT-PCR (A) and detection of KRAS protein in MCF7 and MDA-MB-436 cells (B).10.1371/journal.pone.0038847.g005Figure 5miR-30c effects on KRAS expression and cell proliferation.(A) Schematic representation of miR-30c binding site within the KRAS 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR region.

Significant reduced level of KRAS mRNA expression was detected by qRT-PCR after pre-miR-30c transfection, comparing with scramble control. (D) Regulation of KRAS protein level by miR-30c. MDA-MB-436 cells were transfected with pre-miR-30c or pre-miR-scramble oligonucleotides. After 48 hours KRAS protein was evaluated by western blot. GAPDH was used as loading control. The signal in each line was quantified and the ratio of KRAS to GAPDH was determined. (E) Effect of miR-30c expression on proliferation of MDA-MB-436 cells. MTT cell viability assay was performed at 48, 72, 96, 120 or 144 hours after transfection of MDA-MB-436 cells with pre-miR-30c or pre-miR-scramble oligonucleotides.In addition, pre-miR-30c or pre-miR- control were transfected into MDA-MB-436 cells, and we confirmed a reduction of about 44% of KRAS protein level in MDA-MB-436 cells over-expressing miR-30c, in comparison to control (Figure 5D).miR-30c Affects Proliferation of Breast Cancer CellsTo gain more insight into the biological effects of miR-30c on breast tumorigenesis and given that KRAS plays a role in regulation of cell proliferation, MDA-MB-436 cells, which previously showed elevated levels of KRAS protein, were transfected with pre-miR-30c or scramble and analyzed for cell growth. As shown in Figure 5E, ectopic expression of miR-30c resulted in reduced proliferation in comparison to scramble control transfected cells. Therefore, modulation of KRAS protein level by miR-30c may explain at least in part, why down-regulation of miR-30c can promote proliferation and contribute to tumorigenesis.DiscussionmiRNA profiling studies in various tumor types have demonstrated a widespread miRNA deregulation, providing for new insights in tumor biology, improved classification and opening new avenues for development of novel targeted therapies in cancer. In this study we performed miRNA expression profiling in familial breast tumors and normal breast tissue in order to uncover deregulated miRNAs. The normal breast tissue series was obtained from healthy individuals, both from BRCA1/2- mutation carriers belonging to high risk families, and from mutation-free i
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: ndividuals undergoing breast reduction surgery. This has enabled us to pinpoint miRNAs important for tumorigenesis, by removing the bias induced through effects of BRCA1/2 mutation on miRNA expression. We have defined down-regulation for 17 miRNAs and up-regulation of miR-21 and miR-300 in familial breast tumors when comparing to normal breast tissue.A high proportion of deregulated miRNAs in hereditary tumors were commonly found in previous studies with sporadic breast tumors, suggesting that there are miRNAs that likely regulate important oncogenes involved in both familial and sporadic tumors, irrespective of their genetic background. It was expected that comparing tumor samples with normal tissue, which is characterized by quiescent cells, would uncover miRNAs that may be mainly involved in proliferation. Expression analysis of the 19 differentially expressed miRNAs in HMEC cells, which represent normal proliferating cells, have allowed finding some miRNAs overexpressed in normal tissues that were not overexpressed in normal HMEC cells, such as miR-99a, miR-101 or miR-145, which could have a role in the control of proliferation processes in general. Other miRNAs expressed by both HMEC and normal breast and down-regulated in tumors tissue may be involved in other signaling pathways related to tumoral behavior.Moreover, the pathway enrichment analysis suggested that co-expressed miRNAs seem to collectively target a broad range of signaling pathways related to proliferation and cell migration/motility. Altered cell signaling has long been recognized as a mechanism employed by cells in the development and progression of cancer [18]. Importantly, 20 genes within MAPK signaling pathway were significantly associated with our set of deregulated miRNAs, suggesting that the inhibition of these miRNAs would result in a concomitant activation of MAPK signaling.In breast cancer, MAPKs play a key role in transducing growth signals from the extracellular environment [19], [20]. The activation of the KRAS/MAPK pathway generates a plethora of responses in breast cancer tumors and cell lines, affecting cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and transformation [21]. In breast cancer development, up-regulation of the KRAS/MAPK signaling can occur through multiple facets, and it has been shown to be increased in many breast cancer samples either by over-expression of growth-factor-receptor tyrosine kinases primarily HER2/ErbB-2, EGFR, and IGFR or by activating mutations [22], [23], [24], [25]. Although KRAS is frequently mutated in human cancers including pancreatic, colorectal and lung cancers, KRAS mutations are extremely rare in breast cancer [26], [27]. However wild-type KRAS is significantly activated in breast cancers that over-express EGFR and ErbB2 [28]. Additionally many investigators have reported over-expression of the KRAS-encoded p21 proteins in breast malignancies in comparison to normal breast tissue [29], [30] although the role of this over-expression in breast carcinogenesis has not been determined.Interestingly, KRAS was found to be a target of multiple miRNAs found to be down-regulated in breast tumors. The let-7 family of miRNAs has been shown to regulate multiple oncogenes, including KRAS and c-MYC [16], and miR-143/145 are involved in feed-forward mechanism that potentiates Ras signaling through down-regulation of KRAS and Ras-responsive element-binding protein (RREB1), which represses the miR-143/145 promoter [31]. Here we have identified a novel broadly conserved miRNA, miR-30c, as a direct negative regulator of KRAS expression. Interestingly, miR-30 and let-7 were reported to be markedly reduced in breast tumor-initiating cells and contribute to their self-renewal capacity and undifferentiated state, and ectopic expression of these miRNAs in breast tumor-initiating cell xenografts decreases their tumorigenic and metastatic potential [32]. Furthermore, it has been shown recently that higher expression of miR-30c was significantly associated to benefit of tamoxifen treatment and with longer progression-free survival [33]. Altogether, decreased expression of these miRNAs may release the negative regulation of KRAS. Interestingly, our results showed that at least three KRAS regulating miRNAs (miR-30c, miR-143, and miR-145) had significantly reduced co-expression in tumors and then these miRNAs may act together in the regulation of KRAS oncogene.Signal transduction pathways integrate signals from extracellular stimuli including mitogens, growth factors, hormones and environmental stresses- signals required for tumorigenesis. miRNA deregulation results in the complex modulation of multiple targets belonging to multiple pathways. Commonly deregulated miRNAs in both familial and sporadic breast cancer suggest that commonly altered pathways could be important for tumor progression. Here, we have demonstrated that KRAS inhibition through direct regulation by miR-30c leads to reduced proliferation in breast cancer cells. Similarly, other studies have identified KRAS as a target of several miRNAs down-regulated in tumors (let-7, miR-96 and miR-143), that also have an effect on cancer cell proliferation and tumor invasiveness [15], [16], [17]. Therefore, coordinated down-regulation of miRNAs found in breast tumors would be not only affecting KRAS oncogene expression but also may be targeting other genes of the KRAS/MAPK signaling pathway to cooperatively activate tumorigenic downstream signals.In general a strong similarity between deregulated miRNAs was found in hereditary and sporadic breast cancer when compared to normal breast tissue. However, in order to get miRNAs associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated tumors, a higher number of BRCA1/2 mutated tumors would be needed. In this regard, one study found very similar miRNA expression profiles in high grade serous ovarian carcinomas with or without BRCA1/2 mutations [34]. More studies are guaranteed to determine the role of miRNA more related to familial breast tumors and those specifically associated to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated tumors.In summary, our data defined a deregulated set of miRNAs in hereditary breast tumors, many of them commonly deregulated in sporadic breast cancer. These miRNAs mostly showed significant reduced expression in tumors comparing to normal breast tissue. One of these miRNAs, miR-30c, potentially contributes to breast malignancy formation through release of KRAS suppression suggesting that this miRNA, and likely other miRNAs also targeting KRAS/MAPK signaling, may function as tumor suppressors in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsEthics StatementInformed written consent was obtained from all patients involved in this study to perform genetic studies and to use exceeding material for research, and the research project has the approval of the ethics committee of the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), named Comit\xC3\xA9 de \xC3\xA9tica de la investigaci\xC3\xB3n y de bienestar animal del Instituto de Salud Carlos III.SamplesTumor tissue samples were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer from different Hospitals in Spain. Potential differences regarding ethnicity was not affecting in this case since all tumors were obtained from Spaniards patients. All patients belong to high-risk families with at least three members affected with breast and/or ovarian cancer and at least one of whom was younger than 50 years when diagnosed. For microarray analysis we included whole tissue sections from 22 frozen hereditary breast tumors consisting of 3 BRCA1-mutated, 5 BRCA2 and 14 non-BRCA1/2 (BRCAX) samples, and 14 normal breast tissues including 3 from BRCA1-mutation carriers, 5 from BRCA2-mutation carriers. Histopatological features of the tumors are shown in Table S2, 1 normal breast tissue from contra-lateral breast of patient with BRCAX tumor, and 5 normal breast tissues. Normal breast tissues were obtained after breast reduction surgery from healthy individuals with no family history of breast cancer, and normal breast tissue from BRCA1/2-mutation carriers were obtained after prophylactic surgery. The tissue collection used for validation included 18 paired samples from fresh sporadic breast tumors and their adjacent normal breast tissue counterparts, RNA from 6 additional and 4 normal breast tissue samples was also used for validation. In addition, expression of miR-30c expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR using RNA from FFPE tumor (12 hereditary and 8 sporadic breast tumors) and 9 breast tissue samples.Normal Human Mammary Epithelial Cells (HMEC) (Clonetics) were used to evaluate miRNA expression comparing with normal breast tissue. HMEC cells were grown in MEGM, Mammary Epithelial Growth Medium (Clonetics) supplemented with growth factors SingleQuots (Clonetics) in absence of FBS.miRNA MicroarrayTotal RNA was extracted from primary tumors using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), respectively. Microarray expression profiling was performed using miRCURY LNA\xE2\x84\xA2 microRNA Array kit (Exiqon A/S, Denmark) according to manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s instructions, in a one-color, pair-wise comparison experimental design. Briefly, 300 ng of total RNA was labeled with Hy3 fluorescent dye and subsequently hybridized over 16 h at 56\xC2\xB0C onto a miRNA microarray chip (v.11.0\xE2\x80\x93 hsa, mmu & rno) containing 1940 capture probes, in 4 replicates, representing 831 human miRNAs annotated in miRBasev.11 database. A set of 10 synthetic Spike-in RNAs was added to total RNA sample prior to labeling and later used for quality control. Processed slides were scanned with Agilent Array scanner (Agilent Technologies), with the laser set to 635 nm, at Power 80 and PMT 70 setting, and a scan resolution of 10 \xC2\xB5m. Fluorescence intensities on 
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: scanned images were quantified using Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies) using the modified Exiqon protocol. Average values of the replicate spots were background subtracted and log transformed and subjected to further analysis. Microarray dataset is publicly available at GEO database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/linking.html under GEO accession number GSE32922.Array Data Processing and Statistical AnalysisRaw data were quantile normalized for inter-array variability. Data was preprocessed to eliminate miRNAs with uniformly low expression or with low expression variation (SD<0.3) across the experiments, retaining 466 miRNA genes (306 hsa-miR +160 hsa-miRPlus). Average linkage hierarchical clustering (Pearson correlation, uncentered metrics) from Gene Cluster and Treeview (http://rana.stanford.edu/software) algorithms were used to obtain clustering of the data sets. To determine if there were genes differentially expressed between tumor and normal breast tissue, differential expression analysis was performed using t-test implemented in the POMELO II tool, available in Asterias web server (http://asterias.bioinfo.cnio.es) [35]. The estimated significance level were obtained by permutation testing and p-values were corrected for multiple hypotheses testing using Benjamini & Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment [36]. Those miRNAs with FDR <0.05 were selected as significantly differentially expressed.Quantitative RT-PCR AnalysisQuantitative RT-PCR analysis of miR-30c, miR-100, miR-125b and miR-320a was performed on independent series of familial tumors as well as sporadic breast tumor samples and compared to normal breast tissue samples using miRCURY LNA\xE2\x84\xA2 microRNA PCR System (Exiqon). Briefly, 10 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with miRNA specific primers and Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase, and the cDNA was used as a template for the qPCR reaction using miRNA specific LNA\xE2\x84\xA2 PCR primer and Universal PCR primer. Gene expression levels were quantified using the ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). All experiments were performed in triplicate and the mean of triplicates was used. Normalization was done with SNORA66 RNA and 5S rRNA. Relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method.Pathway Enrichment AnalysisDIANA miRPath pathway enrichment analysis (http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/) was used to gain insight into global molecular networks and canonical pathways related to differentially expressed miRNAs between normal and tumor samples. DIANA miRPath is a web-based computational tool developed to identify molecular pathways potentially altered by the expression of single or multiple microRNAs. The software performs an enrichment analysis of multiple microRNA target genes comparing each set of microRNA targets to all known KEGG pathways. Those pathways showing p-value <0.05, were considered significantly enriched between classes under comparison.Cell Culture, Constructs and TransfectionsThe MDA-MB-436 was kindly provided by Dr. K.S Massey-Brown from Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, USA, and was characterized in previous studies by our group [37]. The MDA-MB-436 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml of Penicillin G and streptomycin. Cells were split 24 h prior to all transfection assays at a confluence 40\xE2\x80\x9370%. Pre-miRNA oligonucleotides (pre-miR-30c and scramble control) were purchased from Ambion (Austin, Texas, USA). For luciferase reporter assay transfection of oligonucleotides and plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Calsbad, CA). For proliferation, and KRAS western blot analysis, pre-miRNA oligonucleotides were transfected to a 50 nM final concentration using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen).KRAS-3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR Luciferase Reporter Assay3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR sequence of the KRAS was retrieved through NCBI nucleotide database. A 300 bp fragment of the 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR region of KRAS gene containing miR-30c binding site, was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA, and cloned into a modified pGL3-Control vector (Promega) at the SacII and EcoRI site, immediately downstream of the luciferase stop codon. Primer sequences used to amplify this region were RAS3UTR-F: 5\xE2\x80\xB2CACGAATTC CACACCCCCACAGAGCTAAC3\xE2\x80\x99 and RAS3UTR-R: 5\xE2\x80\xB2TTCCCGCGGTGTTTGATATGACCAACATTCCT 3\xE2\x80\xB2. Correct vector construction was verified by direct sequencing. Dual luciferase assay was carried out by co-transfecting MDA-MB-436 cells with 25 pmol of pre-miR-30c or scramble control, along with 500 ng of KRAS 3\xE2\x80\xB2UTR- firefly luciferase construct and 7.5 ng of Renilla luciferase vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per well, according to the manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s protocol in a 24-well plate format. Cells were grown for 48 h, after which luciferase activity was assayed with Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Experiments were performed in triplicate and Renilla luciferase activity was used for transfection variation normalization.Detection of KRAS mRNA and Protein LevelsTo detect gene expression levels of KRAS, one \xC2\xB5g of total RNA was reverse transcribed using MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers. The cDNAs were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR assay with the use of labeled probes (Roche Universal Probe library) and the TaqMan Universal PCR Mix in an ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) under manufacturer\xE2\x80\x99s recommendations. The PCR amplification was carried out with 10 min at 95\xC2\xB0C, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95\xC2\xB0C and 1 min at 60\xC2\xB0C, using the oligonucleotides shown in Table S3. \xC3\x9F-actin was used as internal control and allowed normalization of the samples. All experiments were analyzed in triplicate.Western blot analysis was performed using standard procedures for whole-cell extracts from cell lines. Lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of protein lysates (50\xE2\x80\x93100 \xC2\xB5g) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\xE2\x80\x9312% pre-casted gels (Invitrogen), and electrotransferred to nitrocelulose membranes (Wathman) and probed with primary antibody. Antibodies used were KRAS (F234, Santa Cruz) and GAPDH (CNIO, Monoclonal Antibodies Unit). Secondary antibody staining was carried out with anti-mouse HRP IgG (Dakko) and HPR activity was detected with ECL Detection System (GA Healthcare).Cell Proliferation AssayCell viability was assessed by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MDA-MB-436 cells were transfected in independent experiments with pre-miR-30c/pre-miR-Scramble oligonucleotides. Cells were incubated in 1 \xC2\xB5g/\xC2\xB5l MTT Formazan (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in normal culture medium at 37\xC2\xB0C for 5 h. Cell viability was determined at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 or 144 hours after transfection.Supporting InformationFigure S1Validation of miRNA expression by qRT-PCR in hereditary and sporadic tumors.

Although deaths from BC have been decreasing in many Western countries, the incidence of the disease continues to increase. In particular, in countries with historically low incidence, BC rates are rising rapidly, making it now the world\xE2\x80\x99s most prevalent cancer. The increase in incidence is likely at least partly related to changes in weight and reproductive patterns associated with Western lifestyle. Indeed, there is evidence from genetic studies in the US, Iceland, and the UK [2\xE2\x80\x934] of a more-than-threefold increase in age-related incidence of BC not only in the general population but also in those at the highest level of risk with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the last 80\xC2\xA0years [4]. BC rates are also rising in women who have not generally been screened, such as those in their forties [1]. Although cure rates continue to improve such that around 75\xC2\xA0% of women are now cured in Western Europe and North America, the cost of treating BC is considerable, for both the women concerned and health services. Therefore, there is a need not only to predict which women in the whole population will develop the disease but also to apply drug and lifestyle measures in order

The difference in risk between women with extremely dense, as opposed to predominantly fatty, breasts is approximately four- to six-fold [32]. Incorporation of mammographic density into standard risk prediction models has been associated with some improvement in precision of risk prediction [33, 34].Genetic variant assessmentA large number of common genetic variants have now been linked to small increases or decreases in BC risk [35]. These variants, called single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), appear to act in a multiplicative fashion. Those women with no family history of BC can potentially reach a high lifetime risk from the multiplicative effects of SNPs alone [36]. So far, 94 validated SNPs for BC risk have been published [37]. Use of a much smaller panel of SNPs did improve the Gail model in predicting BC [38] and seems to be particularly useful in women with dense breasts [39]. One study identified the proportion of the female population who are at moderate or high risk of BC and hence eligible for increased surveillance and the offer of chemoprevention as per NICE guidance [40]. This study in Canada also showed that Tyrer-Cuzick substantially outperformed the Gail model [40].Model validation in the general populationA study from Marin County in California [41] used data from 12,843 participants who have a higher background risk of BC. Of these women, 203 developed BC during a 5-year follow-up period, showing that Tyrer-Cuzick has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.65 (95\xC2\xA0% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.68) compared with 0.62 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.59 to 0.66) for Gail and 0.60 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.56 to 0.63) for BRCAPRO. The corresponding estimated expected-to-observed ratios for the models were 1.08 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.95 to 1.25), 0.81 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.71 to 0.93), and 0.59 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.52 to 0.68). In women with an age at first birth of more than 30\xC2\xA0years, the AUCs for the Tyrer-Cuzick, Gail, and BRCAPRO models were 0.69 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.62 to 0.75), 0.63 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.56 to 0.70), and 0.62 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.56 to 0.68) and the expected-to-observed ratios were 1.15 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.89 to 1.47), 0.81 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.63 to 1.05), and 0.53 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.41 to 0.68), respectively. A further North American study has shown that Tyrer-Cuzick substantially outperformed the Gail model [42]. The authors applied 10-year absolute risks of BC, using prospective data from 1,857 women over a mean follow-up length of 8.1\xC2\xA0years of whom 83 developed cancer. The 10-year risks assigned by Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick differed ranging widely from 0.001\xC2\xA0% to 79.5\xC2\xA0%. The mean Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick assigned risks of 3.2\xC2\xA0% and 5.5\xC2\xA0%, respectively, were lower than the cohort\xE2\x80\x99s 10-year cumulative probability of developing BC of 6.25\xC2\xA0%. Agreement between assigned and observed risks was better for Tyrer-Cuzick (HL X4(2)\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x897.2, P\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x890.13) than for Gail, which significantly under-predicted cancers (P\xE2\x80\x89<\xE2\x80\x890.001). The Tyrer-Cuzick model also showed better discrimination (AUC\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x8969.5\xC2\xA0%, CI\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x8963.8\xC2\xA0% to 75.2\xC2\xA0%) than the Gail model (AUC\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x8963.2\xC2\xA0%, CI\xE2\x80\x89=\xE2\x80\x8957.6\xC2\xA0% to 68.9\xC2\xA0%). In almost all covariate-specific subgroups, Gail mean risks were significantly lower than the observed risks, whereas Tyrer-Cuzick risks showed generally good agreement with observed risks, even in the subgroups of women who were considered to be at average risk (for example, who had no family history of BC or who were BRCA1/2 mutation-negative). The AUC performances are summarised in Table\xC2\xA03.Table 3Performance of risk models assessed in at least two modelsRisk model performance (country)GailClausBRCAPRO FordTyrer-CuzickBOADICEAQuante et al.

BOADICEA, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation AlgorithmThe Manchester PROCAS (Predicting Risk Of Cancer At Screening) study has also shown that Tyrer-Cuzick is superior to Gail in predicting which women develop BC (Brentnall et al.; 2015; Development of a mammographic density adjusted Tyrer-Cuzick model in 50,000 women in a general population breast screening population: implications for risk stratified screening; unpublished). Importantly, adding an adjustment for mammographic density increases the identification of women at moderate (4,863, 9.9\xC2\xA0%) and high (1,402, 2.8\xC2\xA0%) risk. The cancer rates in these groups were three and four times higher than the lower-risk groupings. Additionally, rates of higher-stage cancers were further increased, suggesting that targeting these groups would allow prevention of more lethal BCs (Brentnall et al.; 2015; Development of a mammographic density adjusted Tyrer-Cuzick model in 50,000 women in a general population breast screening population: implications for risk stratified screening; unpublished).When is the best opportunity to offer risk assessment?It is difficult to apply the NICE guidelines for additional surveillance or offer of chemoprevention within the National Health Service since there is currently no systematic mechanism for identifying moderate/high-risk women. Many/most moderate/high-risk women remain unaware of their BC risk, and only those women who present with concerns about family history are referred to family history clinics. These women are usually under 50 and are offered additional screening (every 12 to 18\xC2\xA0months) and chemoprevention. The one occasion when all women are invited for a health-related visit that appears to be a good related opportunity is their first invitation for screening mammography. In most countries with national population-based screening programmes, this will be at around age 50.We have undertaken a National Institute for Health Research-funded study (PROCAS) in Greater Manchester, which is investigating the feasibility of assessing and communicating BC risk to women in the NHSBSP [43]. To date, over 57,000 women have been recruited from those invited for mammography (43\xC2\xA0% uptake). Interestingly, 95\xC2\xA0% of recruited women indicated that they wished to know their risk of BC. Since risk is not estimated in the general population, it has not been possible until now to assess the proportion of women in the NHSBSP who are at moderate or high risk by NICE criteria or by models of risk which include factors other than family history.We have shown that, among women entering the PROCAS population-based screening cohort study in Greater Manchester at the age of 46 to 49, 0.7\xC2\xA0% met high-risk and 3.0\xC2\xA0% moderate-risk criteria of the NICE algorithm [44]. Only five (13.5\xC2\xA0%) out of 37 of the BCs would have been identified in 160 women if just these elevated risk women had been screened from age 46\xC2\xA0years onwards [43]. The odds of BCs were 5.7 (95\xC2\xA0% CI 1.9 to 14.7) times higher than 17 (0.6\xC2\xA0%) out of 3,033 of those diagnosed in women with no family history of BC. These finding are at an early stage in follow-up, and more time is required to assess whether with further cancers NICE guidance on extra screening in this age group is justified [7]. The PROCAS study has highlighted a disparity between the NICE algorithm and the 10-year risk thresholds as calculated by Tyrer-Cuzick as 8.8\xC2\xA0% of women would have qualified under the NICE 3\xC2\xA0% 10-year risk threshold of age of 40\xC2\xA0years [44]. This is not surprising as the NICE algorithm was set to identify women on the basis of family history alone who would usually meet the 10-year threshold. The additional numbers identified by Tyrer-Cuzick are of those who, in addition to a less significant family history, had other BC risk factors (nulliparity and late first childbirth) such as in three women who developed BC with a single FDR in their fifties [44].When an adjustment is made to the Tyrer-Cuzick model on the basis of a radiologist\xE2\x80\x99s assessment of percentage breast density on a Visual Analogue Scale, the proportion of women meeting high- and moderate-risk criteria rose to 2.8\xC2\xA0% and 9.9\xC2\xA0%, respectively, in the whole 50,000 population thus far assessed (Evans et al.; 2015; Identifying and informing women at high and low-risk of breast cancer in the general population: risk feedback from the first 50,000 women in the Predicting the Risk of Cancer at Screening (PROCAS) study; unpublished). This stratification accurately identified not only those at higher risk but also those with a higher incidence of high-stage (2b or 3) BCs who might have benefited from more frequent surveillance.The PROCAS study has also already shown that it is feasible to collect questionnaire data from women when they attend the screening episode [43]. We have highlighted that certain questions such as whether a relative has had bilateral BC may need validating and would be suitable for an online questionnaire with a prompting system (Evans et al.; 2015; Identifying and informing women at high and low-risk of breast cancer in the general population: risk feedback from the first 50,000 women in the Predicting the Risk of Cancer at Screening 
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: to prevent the disease. BC risk assessment would be essential if risk-stratified screening and preventive measures were to be introduced on a population basis.Currently, women 47 to 73\xC2\xA0years of age are invited for breast screening with 3-yearly mammography in the UK. A similar approach is used in many European countries and in North America, although 2-yearly screening is the norm. A recent review of the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) estimated that it saved around 1,300 lives annually [5]. Although the vast majority of women in the UK receive only 3-yearly screening invitations, more frequent screening has been recommended by National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [6] since 2004 for those at increased familial risk. This includes annual mammography at 40 to 9\xC2\xA0years for women at moderate risk and annual screening at 40 to 60\xC2\xA0years in those at high risk; annual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended at 30 to 50\xC2\xA0years in mutation carriers and those with at least a 30\xC2\xA0% chance of a mutation in BRCA1/2 or TP53. This guidance has just been updated, and the high-risk recommendations are already being implemented in the NHSBSP as highlighted recently [7]. Recent evidence suggests that stratification of risk and screening frequency is likely to be more cost-effective [8\xE2\x80\x9310]. A substantial amount of BC is preventable, but chemoprevention has thus far not been applied to moderate/high-risk UK women outside randomised trials. Chemoprevention involves 5\xC2\xA0years of the selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen or raloxifene, which reduce risk by 35\xC2\xA0% to 40\xC2\xA0% [11\xE2\x80\x9313]. NICE have reviewed chemoprevention for women at moderate/high familial BC risk (at least 17\xC2\xA0% lifetime). Final guidance is \xE2\x80\x98offering/considering\xE2\x80\x99 tamoxifen/raloxifene for women at high/moderate risk [13, 14]. However, applying such guidance requires estimation of risk in the general population of women [15, 16].

In a study using questionnaires in a general practice [17], 42.0\xC2\xA0% of patients responded and 1.6\xC2\xA0% were found to meet familial BC screening criteria at the time [19]. These data were based on only 196 replies in this age range, and the criteria were stricter at the time than later NICE guidance as there was a necessity for an average age of less than 60\xC2\xA0years when there were two affected relatives. In a study predominantly concerning family history of 8,019 practice patients 35 to 69\xC2\xA0years of age [17], only 4.8\xC2\xA0% reported having a first-degree relative (FDR) with BC who was less than 70\xC2\xA0years old. The general practice survey was based on nurses appraising BC family history at attendance for health checks and may be biased toward a more health-aware population. A different approach was taken by a Dutch study [20] that assessed the number of relatives of BC patients who would meet criteria for referral in The Netherlands under the older UK criteria [19]. The investigators found that 0.25 FDRs per patient (or an average of one for every four patients with BC) would have met eligibility criteria per case of BC in a series of 1,060 BC-affected women. If one assumes that 12.5\xC2\xA0% of women develop BC in their lifetime [1], this might translate to 3.1\xC2\xA0% (that is, 12.5\xE2\x80\x89\xC3\x97\xE2\x80\x890.25) of the population. As such, family history alone is a blunt tool in a population setting and overall has poor prediction of which women will develop BC as the majority of women even with early-onset BC do not have a family history of the disease [21].Which risk model should be used?A number of BC risk models have been developed in the last 25\xC2\xA0years [22]. These incorporate known genetic, reproductive, and other risk factors to a greater or lesser extent (Table\xC2\xA01). Age and gender alone are extremely strong predictors of BC risk. Gail and colleagues [23, 24] described a risk assessment model which focuses primarily on non-genetic risk factors with limited information on family history. A model of relative risks for various combinations of the utilised risk factors (Table\xC2\xA02) was developed from case-control data from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project. Individualized BC probabilities from information on relative risks and the baseline hazard rate are generated. These calculations take competing risks and the interval of risk into account. The data depend on having periodic breast surveillance. The Gail model was originally designed to determine eligibility for the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial [23] and has since been modified (in part to adjust for race) and made available on the National Cancer Institute website [25]. The model has been validated in a number of settings and probably works best in general assessment clinics, where family history is not the main reason for referral [23\xE2\x80\x9325], but it should also be useful for utilization in general population screening programmes, as it has now been recalibrated to reflect more recent BC incidence rates. The major limitation of the Gail model is the inclusion of only first-degree relatives, which results in underestimating risk in the 50\xC2\xA0% of the group with familial risk of cancer in the paternal lineage. The model also takes no account of age of onset of BC.Table 2Known breast cancer risk factors and their incorporation into existing risk prediction modelsRelative risk at extremesGailClausBRCAPRO FordTyrer-CuzickBOADICEAPredictionPersonal informationAge (20 to 70)30 (20 versus 70)YesYesYesYesYesBody mass index/weight gain2 (loss versus gain from 30) [49]NoNoNoYesNoAlcohol intake1.28 [28] (0 versus 4 units) dailyNoNoNoNoNoHormonal/reproductive factorsAge of menarche1.5 (<10 versus >16) [57]YesNoNoYesNoAge of first live birth3 (>35 versus <19) [58]YesNoNoYesNoAge of menopause2 (>55 versus <40) [57]NoNoNoYesNoHormone replacement therapy use2 (combined for 10\xC2\xA0years current versus never) [59]NoNoNoYesNoOral contraceptive pill use1.24 (current versus never) [60]NoNoNoNoNoBreast feeding0.8 (>4\xC2\xA0years versus none) [61]NoNoNoNoNoPlasma oestrogen6 [62]NoNoNoNoNoPersonal breast diseaseBreast biopsies2 [63]YesNoNoYesNoAtypical ductal hyperplasia4 [63]YesNoNoYesNoLobular carcinoma in situ\\n4 [63]NoNoNoYesNoMammographic breast density6 [64]Has been modelled in some studiesNoNoYesNoFamily historyFirst-degree relatives3.6 [65] (2 versus none in FDR)YesYesYesYesYesSecond degree relatives1.5 [65]NoYesYesYesYesThird-degree relativesNoNoNoNoYesAge of onset of breast cancer3 (<50 in sister versus none) [65]NoYesYesYesYesBilateral breast cancer3 (<50 in FDR versus none)NoNoYesYesYesOvarian cancer1.5 [26]NoNoYesYesYesMale breast cancer3 (<45\xC2\xA0years in daughters) [64]NoNoYesYesYesGenetic testing\\nBRCA1/2\\n15NoNoYesYesYesSNPs10 (top 1\xC2\xA0% versus bottom 1\xC2\xA0% for 77 SNPs) [67]Has been added in some studiesNoSoonSoonSoonBOADICEA, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm; FDR, first-degree relative; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism. Table adapted from [68]The Claus model [26] and BRCAPRO [27] are primarily genetic models calculating the likelihood of either a putative high-risk dominant gene [26] or BRCA1/2 [27]. BC risks are imputed from this calculation. As such, given the rarity of BRCA1/2 or the putative dominant gene in the Claus model, these models are useful in the familial setting only and are not relevant to assessment on a population basis in which the great majority of women have no family history. BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm) [28] is another model developed primarily to assess genetic risk but has been validated in a population-based series of BCs. Although inclusion of non-genetic risks are anticipated, these are not yet available in the online model.The Tyrer-Cuzick model [29], based partly on a dataset acquired from the International Breast Intervention Study (IBIS) and other epidemiological data, incorporates both familial and non-genetic risk factors in a comprehensive way [29]. The major advantage over the Claus model and BRCAPRO is that the model gives consideration to the presence of multiple genes of differing penetrance. It does give a read-out of BRCA1/2 but also gives consideration to a lower-penetrance BRCAX. As such, the Tyrer-Cuzick model addresses many of the pitfalls of the previous models, significantly the combination of extensive family history, markers of endogenous oestrogen exposure, and benign breast disease (atypical hyperplasia). Therefore, it is unsurprising that the model tends to perform better than
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: (PROCAS) study; unpublished). The PROCAS study has now given risk feedback to nearly 700 women, and 75\xC2\xA0% of those invited at high risk (at least 8\xC2\xA0% 10-year risk) attended a telephone interview or face-to-face appointment. Re-attendance rates increased significantly to 94\xC2\xA0% (229 out of 244) in high-risk women who had been invited for a follow-up 3-year mammogram and were equivalent to usual re-attendance rates in those at low risk (84\xC2\xA0%) (Evans et al.; 2015; Identifying and informing women at high and low-risk of breast cancer in the general population: risk feedback from the first 50,000 women in the Predicting the Risk of Cancer at Screening (PROCAS) study; unpublished).At least two other large studies with aims similar to those of PROCAS are under way. The Karma study in Sweden aims to recruit 100,000 women at their 2-yearly screening appointment [45]. Blood DNA is collected in addition to questionnaire data and mammographic density measurement [45]. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) (Mireille Broeders, personal communication) started recruitment in The Netherlands in 2014 and aims to collect risk factor data on 90,000 screening participants, including 30,000 blood samples.What is the best age to undertake risk assessment?Only 20\xC2\xA0% of BC occurs at ages below 50\xC2\xA0years, when most population-based screening programmes commence. However, 15\xC2\xA0% do occur between the ages of 40 to 50\xC2\xA0years, and women in this age group could benefit from NICE-approved extra surveillance and chemoprevention. Primary care physicians and all others undertaking risk assessment need to be aware that moderate risk can be achieved with less significant family history if there are other adverse risk factors. Around 3.7\xC2\xA0% (95\xC2\xA0% CI 3.1\xC2\xA0% to 4.3\xC2\xA0%) of women in PROCAS at 46 to 49\xC2\xA0years of age would have met NICE moderate/high-risk criteria following the NICE algorithm at 40\xC2\xA0years of age, but this rises to 8.8\xC2\xA0% (95\xC2\xA0% CI 8.0\xC2\xA0% to 9.7\xC2\xA0%) when Tyrer-Cuzick is used (Evans et al.; 2015; Identifying and informing women at high and low-risk of breast cancer in the general population: risk feedback from the first 50,000 women in the Predicting the Risk of Cancer at Screening (PROCAS) study; unpublished). Thus, up to 8.8\xC2\xA0% of the female population in their forties could be offered annual mammography as per moderate-risk screening recommendations and be at least considered for tamoxifen [44]. When expanded to the whole population of PROCAS, 4,225 (8.6\xC2\xA0%) of 49,639 women (thus far evaluated) met moderate-risk criteria, and 597 (1.2\xC2\xA0%) met the 8\xC2\xA0% 10-year risk high-risk criteria. Feedback has been offered to 866 women at high-risk, including those with moderate risk + >60\xC2\xA0% (high) mammographic density (which equates to an 8\xC2\xA0% 10-year risk), and 568 (78.5\xC2\xA0%) of these women have received risk feedback. Two hundred and eighty-three (86\xC2\xA0%) out of 330 of those offered extra interval screening have commenced additional breast screening. Four BCs have now been identified at an early stage on the 18-month mammogram [45].What preventive options should be discussed?LifestyleWomen attending a risk assessment appointment could have a wide-ranging discussion on modifiable BC risks regardless of their actual predicted risk of BC. Some authors have suggested that half of BCs may be prevented by reversing the major modifiable risk factors, including achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, regular physical activity, minimal alcohol intake, and chemoprevention [46]. The risk appointment would be an opportunity to provide health advice related to weight gain, which has a large effect on BC risk as well as other cancers (especially endometrial), diabetes, and heart disease. High-quality observational data show that weight gain in the pre-menopausal period and being overweight or obese after the menopause increase BC risk [46, 47]. A meta-analysis estimated that for each 5-kg/m2 increase in body mass index the risk of BC was increased by 12\xC2\xA0% [48]. Further evidence from two large observational studies indicates that pre- or post-menopausal weight loss reduces post-menopausal BC risk. Sustained weight reduction of 5\xC2\xA0% of body weight in the IOWA Women\xE2\x80\x99s Health Study reduced post-menopausal BC risk by 25\xC2\xA0% to 40\xC2\xA0% compared with women who continued to gain weight [49]. In the Nurses\xE2\x80\x99 Health Study, post-menopausal women who maintained a body weight reduction of 10\xC2\xA0kg or more and did not take hormone replacement therapy had a 50\xC2\xA0% reduction in BC risk [50]. A review of 73 observational studies indicated that moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity reduced the risk of BC by approximately 25\xC2\xA0% in pre- and post-menopausal women compared with inactive women [51]. Alcohol is estimated to increase BC risk by 7\xC2\xA0% to 10\xC2\xA0% for each 10-g increase in daily alcohol intake [35]. The Nurses\xE2\x80\x99 Health Study showed that women who consumed three to six drinks per week were 15\xC2\xA0% more likely to develop BC compared with never-drinkers [52]. On the basis of the evidence available, all women could be advised at a risk evaluation at their screening appointment to maintain a healthy weight or lose weight if overweight, to take regular exercise, and to minimize alcohol intake.ChemopreventionThere have been nine randomised trials of SERMs [13] and two trials of aromatase inhibitors [53, 54]. These have been carried out mainly in women at increased risk of BC, but one trial was in women with osteoporosis and another in women with or at high risk of diabetes or heart disease (raloxifene). In the SERM trials, 83,399 participants were included, with more than 300,000\xC2\xA0years of follow-up over an average period of 65\xC2\xA0months. The overall reduction in BC (including ductal carcinoma in situ) using tamoxifen 20\xC2\xA0mg per day was 38\xC2\xA0% (P\xE2\x80\x89<\xE2\x80\x890.0001) [13], and estimated reduction in 10-year cumulative BC incidence ranged from 6.3\xC2\xA0% in the control group to 4.2\xC2\xA0% in the SERM groups. On the basis of this evidence, NICE approved the use of both tamoxifen and raloxifene (post-menopausal only) for prevention of BC in women at familial risk [7]. When compared in a randomised trial, tamoxifen was significantly superior to raloxifene in longer-term follow-up for preventing invasive BC (relative risk raloxifene/tamoxifen 1:24, 95\xC2\xA0% CI 1.05 to 1.47), but raloxifene was associated with fewer side effects, particularly with respect to the uterus, and may be preferable in post-menopausal women [14]. A recent analysis of the IBIS I tamoxifen prevention trial indicated that the reduction of risk lasted up to 15\xC2\xA0years after the 5-year treatment with tamoxifen [55].Aromatase inhibitors given after surgery to prevent BC relapse are generally superior to tamoxifen. This led to the initiation of two placebo-controlled trials in post-menopausal women at increased risk of BC. One tested exemestane and reported a 65\xC2\xA0% reduction in BC risk after 5\xC2\xA0years of treatment [53]. In the other trial (IBIS II), anastrozole was compared with placebo [54]. In total, 3,864 post-menopausal women who were between 40 and 70\xC2\xA0years old and at increased risk of BC were randomly assigned. The first report indicated that BC incidence was reduced by 53\xC2\xA0% (hazard risk 0.47, 95\xC2\xA0% CI 0.32 to 0.68) by use of anastrozole. Compared with SERMs, aromatase inhibitors are not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic disease and uterine problems, including cancer, but are associated with increased mild to moderate bone/muscle pain and reduced bone density.Unfortunately, the IBIS II study was not available for NICE guidance and therefore aromatase inhibitor use in the UK would be without the current backing of NICE. Clearly, for chemoprevention to have a major impact on BC incidence, high levels of uptake would be required although potentially more than 20\xC2\xA0% of BCs could be targeted [44].ConclusionsThe first mammography screening appointment at 47 to 50\xC2\xA0years of age provides an ideal teachable moment to assess BC risk and inform women of lifestyle and other measures to reduce BC risk. In the future, this may also allow the introduction of risk-stratified screening which already exists to some extent in many screening programmes; the NHSBSP has already introduced very high-risk screening with MRI mainly in women with mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or TP53. The PROCAS study has shown that it is feasible to collect risk information and, using a good discriminating risk model, provide accurate assessments of women\xE2\x80\x99s risk of BC, although further improvements in risk discrimination are needed. These models should ideally be adapted to include mammographic density information and potentially common genetic risk modifiers (SNPs). The screening appointment would provide an opportunity to help reduce disease burden from not only BC but other common diseases. It appears that the great majority of women wish to know their risk, although this would need to be validated by inviting whole populations to an opt-in or -out risk assessment rather than seeking consent for a research study. More widespread introduction of chemoprevention, using tamoxifen in pre-menopausal women and raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors in post-menopausal women, could substantially reduce BC incidence, although uptake rates would need to rise above the approximately 10\xC2\xA0% seen in most studies [56]. Further research would be required to determine whether women need to be reassessed at least at one further time point to determine changes to risk related to menopausal status, mammographic density, and other changes to risk factors.

There are various areas where clinical research is active, including benign tumours and risk factors for malignant transformation, biological evolution of normal and cancerous cells, prevention, screening, diagnosis, therapeutic strategies, rehabilitation and maintenance of quality of life.This document concerns the diagnosis and therapeutic management of nonmetastatic breast cancer, and does not cover screening or prevention. This is a summary of an update (Mauriac et al, 2001) of the version published in 1996 (Mauriac et al, 1996), in which sections concerning some particular situations and in situ carcinomas have not been included (these will be covered in a specific document). In addition, breast cancer with a genetic predisposition (BRCAX) will not be specifically covered in this document.METHODSThe \xE2\x80\x98Standards, Options and Recommendations\xE2\x80\x99 (SOR) project, which started in 1993, involves a collaboration between the Federation of French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), the 20 French Regional Cancer Centres, several French public university and general hospitals, private clinics and cancer-learned societies. The main objective of the SOR project is to develop clinical practice guidelines which can be used to improve the quality of health care and outcomes for cancer patients. The methodology is based on a literature review, followed by critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts to produce draft guidelines which are then validated by specialists in cancer-care delivery. The details of the methodology used for developing these SOR have been described previously (Fervers et al, 2001).A multidisciplinary working group was set up by the FNCLCC. References to pertinent articles were identified by the global bibliographic monitoring process of MEDLINE, set up in 1996 and by specific searches in other databases such as Embase\xC2\xAE, Cancerlit\xC2\xAE and the Cochrane Library\xC2\xAE, and from the personal reference lists of the members of the working group. In addition, the French National Agency for Health Accreditation and Evaluation (ANAES) provided a complementary updated bibliographic search (1999 to October 2000). After selection and critical appraisal of these articles, the members of the working group drafted the SORs.\xE2\x80\x98Standards\xE2\x80\x99 identify clinical situations for which there exist strong indications or contraindications for a particular intervention and \xE2\x80\x98Options\xE2\x80\x99 identify situations for which there are several alternatives, none of which have shown clear superiority over the others (Table 1Table 1Definition of \xE2\x80\x98Standards, Options and Recommendations\xE2\x80\x99StandardsProcedures or treatments which are considered to be of benefit, inappropriate or harmful by unanimous decision based on the best available evidence\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0OptionsProcedures or treatments which are considered to be of benefit, inappropriate or harmful by a majority, based on the best available evidence\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0RecommendationsAdditional information to enable the available options to be ranked using expect criteria (e.g. survival, toxicity) with an indication of the level of evidence). In any SOR, there can be several \xE2\x80\x98Options\xE2\x80\x99 for a given clinical situation. \xE2\x80\x98Recommendations\xE2\x80\x99 enable the \xE2\x80\x98Options\xE2\x80\x99 to be weighed according to the available evidence. Several interventions can be recommended for the same clinical situation, so that clinicians can make a choice according to specific clinical parameters, for example, local circumstances, skills, equipment, resources and patient preferences. Adapting the SORs to a local situation is possible if the reason for the choice is sufficiently transparent and this is crucial for successful implementation. Inclusion of patients in clinical trials is an appropriate form of patient management in oncology and is recommended frequently within the SORs, particularly in situations where evidence is too weak to support an intervention.The type of evidence underlying any \xE2\x80\x98Standard\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98Option\xE2\x80\x99 or \xE2\x80\x98Recommendation\xE2\x80\x99, is indicated using a classification developed by the FNCLCC based on previously published models. The level of evidence depends not only on the type and quality of the studies reviewed, but also on the concordance of the results (Table 2Table 2Definition of level of evidenceLevel AThere exists a high standard meta-analysis or several high-standard randomised clinical trials which give consistent results\xC2\xA0Level BThere exists good quality evidence from randomised trials (B1) or prospective or retrospective studies (B2).

When no clear scientific evidence exists, judgement is made according to the professional experience and consensus of the expert group (\xE2\x80\x98expert agreement\xE2\x80\x99).The document containing the SORs was then reviewed by a group of independent experts (see the appendix) and after taking into consideration their comments, the guidelines were validated by the working group.This document summarises the key recommendations from the complete updated edition that has been published in French as a monograph (Mauriac, et al, 2001) and a French summary version (Mauriac et al, 2002) and is also available at the Internet address: http://www.fnclcc.fr.CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS (FIGURE 1 AND FIGURE 2)Diagnostic work-up of an abnormality in the breastClinical examinationFigure 1Diagnosis\xE2\x80\x93clinically detectable breast abnormality.Figure 2diagnosis\xE2\x80\x93impalpable mammographic abnormality.In patients with locally and regionally advanced disease, clinical examination is likely to be of greater diagnostic value than in patients with less advanced disease (standard). Tumours with the following characteristics are unlikely to be operable, and are associated with a poor short-term prognosis: inflammatory change, deep extension, lymphadenopathy, breast oedema and/or lymphoedema in the upper limbs. These factors also indicate an increased risk of locoregional and metastatic recurrence (standard). Thus, nonoperability is not always due to difficulties associated with the surgery itself. Surgery may still be appropriate, however, to achieve local control, despite a poor prognosis. Imaging can be used to confirm findings from clinical examination. In some cases, clinical examination will be normal, so that the diagnosis will only be possible following imaging (standard).Diagnostic imagingA standard bilateral mammogram with two views (front and external oblique), can be complemented by other views and by ultrasonography (standard). The equipment used for mammography should undergo regular quality control (standard). To confirm the diagnosis, additional views and enlargements may be necessary (option).Specific imaging is not indicated in the examination of lymphadenopathy. Standard reporting of mammograms should be used in which the stated diagnosis is based on the mammographic features suspicious of malignancy using the American College of Radiology classification (recommendation).The diagnostic findings should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team. When the level of suspicion from imaging justifies histological verification, this should be done using interventional breast diagnostic techniques in an outpatient setting under a local anaesthetic.Pretreatment diagnosisThe diagnosis of malignancy can be obtained from cytology (fine-needle aspiration) or tissue sample (core biopsy), whereas the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma can only be made from a biopsy sample (standard).The histological diagnosis of impalpable lesions should be compared with the diagnostic hypotheses generated from diagnostic imaging (recommendation). The diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical hyperplasia from a needle biopsy sample should always be reconfirmed using a sample obtained by surgical excision (recommendation, level of evidence: B1). Regular assessment of the diagnostic performance of image-guided biopsy systems is recommended (recommendation, expert agreement).PATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION AND CLASSIFICATIONFrozen sectionsExamination of frozen sections is not indicated for isolated clusters of microcalcification or for a tumour measuring less than 10\xE2\x80\x89mm (standard). It is indicated in other cases where it is likely to modify the surgical plan (standard). This examination should not jeopardise the quality of the excised sample and therefore the reliability of the final histological diagnosis (standard).Surgic
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: al marginsThe standard histological report should mention the findings from the diagnostic work-up and all factors necessary for establishing the prognosis:\\nthe size of the malignant lesion(s) (in mm);the histological type;the histological grade (specifying the grading system used);the percentage of any ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS);the presence of peritumoral vascular invasion;the status of the surgical margins, including that of all additional excised samples.For an invasive tumour, the measurement of the infiltrating component should be given, including data from macroscopic and microscopic examinations (recommendation). The overall size of the lesions (including the invasive component and any associated intraductal component) can be documented (option, expert agreement).If there is intraductal carcinoma only, the size of the lesions should be assessed by combining the findings from the radiological and histopathological examinations (recommendation). If this assessment is difficult (multiple foci, etc.), the number of \xE2\x80\x98positive\xE2\x80\x99 sections out of the total number of sections examined should be stated (recommendation, expert agreement).The quality of the excised sample is defined by two criteria (recommendation):\\nthe distance (in mm) between all malignant foci and the nearest excision margin (identified using surgical guide marks);the nature of the tumour lesion (invasive or intraductal) nearest to the surgical margin.In cases where the surgical margin is invaded by tumour, the extent of this should be specified (recommendation, expert agreement).MastectomyThe standard histological report for a mastectomy sample should state the details of the diagnostic work-up and those factors required to establish the prognosis:\\nthe sites and number of malignant lesions;the size of the malignant lesions (in mm);the histological type of the tumour;the histological grade (specifying the grading system used);the percentage of DCIS, if present;the presence of peritumoral vascular invasion;the presence of extension into the nipple (specifying position and type: intraductal, infiltrating, Paget's disease);the presence if any of cutaneous or pectoralis major fasciomuscular involvement.For an invasive tumour, the extent of the invasive component should be given, integrating data from macroscopic and microscopic examinations (recommendation). The overall extent of the lesions (including the invasive component and any associated intraductal component) can be documented (option, expert agreement).If there is intraductal carcinoma only, the size of the lesions should be assessed by integrating the data from radiological and microscopic examinations (recommendation). If this assessment is difficult (multiple foci, etc.), the number of \xE2\x80\x98positive\xE2\x80\x99 sections out of the total number of sections examined should be given (recommendation, expert agreement).Axillary dissectionAll lymph nodes removed by axillary dissection should undergo full histological examination using a series of macroscopic sections (standard).The standard histological report for the samples from axillary dissection should specify:\\nthe number of lymph nodes examined;the number of metastatic lymph nodes, including the presence of micrometastases and if a sentinel node biopsy was performed before axillary dissection (standard);the number of metastatic lymph nodes with capsular rupture.Optimal quality for axillary examination requires sampling from at least 10 lymph nodes (standard, level of evidence: B1). This is usually achieved by a level I/II axillary dissection (standard, level of evidence: B1). Surgical guide marks should be made to orientate the sample, at least at one end (standard). The technique of sentinel node biopsy may avoid axillary dissection in 85\xE2\x80\x9390% of patients without lymph node involvement (level of evidence: B1), but cannot be recommended until the results of ongoing studies are available (recommendation, expert agreement). This technique requires input from a multidisciplinary team experienced in the area (recommendation, level of evidence: B1).Histological classification of breast cancerThe standard histological classification of breast cancer is that developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) (standard). The standard for histo-prognostic grading is that developed by Elston and Ellis (standard). This is applicable to all invasive cancers with the exception of medullary carcinomas and in situ carcinomas (standard). The coding of lesions can be performed using the CIMO/SNOMED system (WHO classification) and/or the ADICAP system (French classification) (option).INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE DETECTION OF METASTATIC DISEASEThere is no indication to undertake a metastatic screening before the confirmation of a diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma (standard). This is also true for in situ carcinomas (standard).If a mastectomy is planned, a metastatic screening should be performed prior to surgery to avoid unnecessary surgery in women who already have metastatic disease, even if the probability is low (recommendation). In the absence of symptoms, a metastatic screening should only be performed after evaluation of the metastatic risk factors (see section on Prognostic factors) (recommendation). Assays of CA 15.3 and other tumour markers should not be done during the initial work-up because of their low sensitivity (standard, level of evidence: B2). At a more advanced stage of disease, they are often elevated but have no diagnostic value. Tumour markers can sometimes be used as a reference when poor prognostic factors are present (option). No study has shown an independent prognostic value for tumour markers. Nonspecific markers, such as CA 125, CA19-9 and TPA, should not be assayed (standard).PROGNOSTIC FACTORSPredictive factors for lymph node involvementIt is essential to perform a clinical examination of the axillary region even though it is imprecise (standard, level of evidence: B1). Lymph node involvement generally progresses towards the apex of the axilla (standard, level of evidence: B1). Tumour size is the principal risk factor for lymph node involvement (standard, level of evidence: B1). Histologically confirmed axillary involvement, tumour size and young age are the main predictive factors for internal mammary node involvement (standard, level of evidence: B2). The influence of the tumour site is controversial.Predictive factors for local breast recurrenceThe most important clinical factors are young age (under 35 or 40 years old) and premenopausal status. The most important histological factors are: positive excision margins and the presence of an extensive ductal in situ component associated with the invasive component, high-grade tumour, the presence of peritumoral vascular invasion and inappropriate treatment.Predictive factors for metastatic diseaseThe most important clinical factors are young age (under 35 or 40 years old), tumour size and axillary node involvement. The histological factors with the strongest prognostic value are tumour size, histologically confirmed node involvement, the number of axillary nodes involved (\xE2\xA9\xBE4), a high-grade tumour and positive excision margins. The presence of peritumoral vascular invasion is also a predictive factor for metastatic disease.Predictive factors for therapeutic responseHormone receptor status should be determined in all cases of invasive disease (standard), using either a biochemical or immunohistochemical method (standard). The analysis for overexpression of c-erbB-2 should not be performed on a routine basis (standard). The predictive factors for response to chemotherapy, including c-erbB-2, are in the process of being evaluated. Cellular proliferation should be assessed in all infiltrating tumours, using either the mitotic index, S phase fraction measurement or Ki67 immunohistochemical assay (recommendation, expert agreement). Quality control is mandatory in all laboratories irrespective of the prognostic test performed (standard).TREATMENT MODALITIESSurgeryIrrespective of the surgical technique used, tumour excision should be complete with negative margins and should be adapted to the tumour size and the breast volume (standard). The optimal size of excision to ensure negative margins has not been defined (standard).When breast-conserving surgery is to be undertaken, the aesthetic result should be acceptable to the patient (standard). Central tumours can be treated in a conservative manner if excision is complete (sometimes requiring excision of the nipple\xE2\x80\x93areolar complex) (option).Modified radical mastectomy is equivalent to radical mastectomy in terms of local control and survival (standard). Breast-conserving treatments with lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy are equivalent to mastectomy in terms of local recurrence and survival (standard, level of evidence: A). Subcutaneous mastectomy should not be considered for invasive or noninvasive breast cancer (recommendation, expert agreement).Complications after axillary node dissectionThere appears to be no technique available to assess the risk of sequelae (particularly lymphoedema) following surgery to this anatomically complex and strategic area where several different lymphatic regions converge (back, legs, anterior thoracic wall and breast). Early physiotherapy for the shoulder and the thoracic wall is by far the most significant preventative treatment. Informing patients of the best means of prevention remains the best means of preventing lymphoedema. Lymphatic drainage is not indicated as a preventative measure (recommendation).RadiotherapyRadiotherapy reduces the risk of mortality due to breast cancer (standard, level of evidence: A). However, it may increase the risk of long-term cardiovascular mortality if an inappropriate technique is used. Breast, chest wall or lymph node irradiation should be performed with caution, with the aim of limiting the irrad

It is also possible to irradiate the lymph nodes without axillary surgery (option).\xE2\x80\x93 Invaded margins and/or presence of residual microcalcifications: Modified radical mastectomy should be performed (standard). In the event of lymph node involvement, this should be followed by the chest wall and lymph nodes (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) irradiation (standard). Re-excision combined with axillary dissection, followed by breast radiotherapy can be undertaken. Breast radiotherapy with a boost to the tumour bed can also be considered (option).Management of a single, palpable, Localised tumour treatable by breast-conserving surgeryA single palpable localised tumour can be completely excised with a wide margin (Figure 6Figure 3Impalpable operable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.Figure 4Operable impalpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.Figure 5Operable impalpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.Figure 6Operable palpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.). This is dependent on the probability of achieving an excision with clear margins and a satisfactory aesthetic result.First decision step (Figure 7Figure 7Operable palpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.): Lumpectomy (\xC2\xB1frozen section), axillary dissection and breast radiotherapy is the standard. The breast should always be irradiated; this has been shown to reduce considerably the rate of local recurrence (recommendation, level of evidence. A). Axillary dissection should only be undertaken after the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma has been confirmed (recommendation, expert agreement). It is essential to examine all tissue margins (recommendation). Central tumours can be managed with conservative treatment (recommendation, expert agreement). If the patient refuses conservative treatment, a modified radical mastectomy can be considered (option). If microcalcifications are present, a postoperative mammogram is essential to verify the presence or absence of residual lesions after conservative treatment (standard, expert agreement).Second decision step (Figure 8Figure 8Operable palpable tumour\xE2\x80\x93locoregional treatment.): This step follows conservative treatment and depends on the histological status of the tissue margins and the presence of other risk factors.\\n\xE2\x97\x8B Clear excision margins (Figure 8): Whole breast radiotherapy should be performed (standard) with an additional dose to the tumour bed (boost) if the patient is under 50 years old (standard).

If the patient refuses re-excision, breast radiotherapy with a boost to the tumour bed can be considered (option). Modified radical mastectomy can also be considered (option).\xE2\x80\x93 When re-excision is impossible (the margins will be involved after re-excision, and/or the aesthetic result will not be satisfactory). Modified radical mastectomy should be performed (standard). Immediate breast reconstruction can be considered if there are no other risk factors for locoregional recurrence and/or this does not prejudice the administration of additional treatment (option)..If the patient refuses mastectomy and there is a high risk of metastatic recurrence or if there is minimal invasion of the excised tissue margins, breast radiotherapy and a boost to the tumour bed can be proposed (option, level of evidence: D).Third decision step (Figure 10Figure 10Operable tumour\xE2\x80\x93indication for nodal radiotherapy.): This depends on the extent of axillary node involvement.\\n\xE2\x97\x8B Absence of axillary node involvement: The decision depends on the tumour localisation.\\n\xE2\x80\x93 Lateral tumour\xE2\x80\x83The nodal areas should not be irradiated (standard).\xE2\x80\x93 Central and/or medial tumour\xE2\x80\x83The internal mammary chain should be irradiated (standard).

Nodal irradiation for low-risk tumours is not recommended, and is currently under evaluation.\\n\xE2\x80\x93 Irrespective of the tumour localisation, axillary radiotherapy should not be performed in the absence of histologically proven nodal involvement (recommendation, level of evidence: A).\xE2\x97\x8B Presence of axillary node involvement: Screen for distant metastases (standard) and irradiate infra- and supraclavicular plus internal mammary nodes (standard). If extensive nodal involvement is present, the whole of the axillary region can be irradiated (option). Radiotherapy should only be omitted in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (option).Palpable tumour, primary breast-conserving surgery not possibleFirst decision step: A metastatic screen should be undertaken (standard) (Figure 11Figure 11Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible.). A modified radical mastectomy should be performed in the absence of metastases (standard). Nonsurgical treatment (medical or radiotherapy) can be considered (option). Nonsurgical treatment is not indicated for multifoci lesions where the local treatment should be mastectomy (recommendation, expert agreement). If primary radiotherapy or medical treatment is performed, locoregional control must be obtained (recommendation, level of evidence: A) (Figure 12Figure 12Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible\xE2\x80\x93local treatment after neoadjuvant radiotherapy.).\\nA preliminary biopsy can be performed to assess the prognostic factors that are necessary to guide locoregional and adjuvant treatment (recommendation, expert agreement). When immediate reconstruction is offered, it should not jeopardise the administration of locoregional and/or systemic treatment (recommendation).Second decision step (Figure 13Figure 13Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible: modified radical mastectomy.): This step occurs after mastectomy and axillary dissection and is dependent on the presence or absence of risk factors for local recurrence.\\n\xE2\x97\x8B Absence of risk factors for local recurrence: Chest wall radiotherapy is not indicated (standard).\xE2\x97\x8B Presence of risk factors for local recurrence: Chest wall radiotherapy is indicated (standard).Third decision step (Figure 10): This step is dependent on the extent of axillary node involvement (see section on \xE2\x80\x98Management of a single palpable localised tumour treatable by breast-conserving surgery, third decision step\xE2\x80\x99).Adjuvant therapy (Figure 14)Figure 14Operable tumour\xE2\x80\x93adjuvant treatment.The aim of adjuvant therapy is to reduce the risk of metastatic recurrence and thus improve survival. Risk factors for metastatic recurrence should be assessed during the initial examination and from the histopathological examination of surgical specimens. Adjuvant therapy should not replace optimal locoregional treatment. The patient's menopausal status and the tumour hormone receptor status should be used in the selection of one of the reference treatments: hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy.Adjuvant therapy after surgery and initial axillary dissection with the possibility of breast conservationThe standards, options and recommendations are summarised in Table 3Table 3Management of patients with breast cancer with lymph node involvement (N+ve)\xC2\xA0Premenopaual woman or \xE2\xA9\xBD50 years old (Figure 16)Post menopausal woman or >50 years old (Figure 17)\xC2\xA0ER+veER\xE2\x88\x92ve or unknownER+ve or unknownER\xE2\x88\x92veStandardsChemotherapy and tamoxifenChemotherapy, no hormone therapyTamoxifenNo standard\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0\xC2\xA0OptionsChemotherapy and ovarian suppression \xC2

The dose prescription is standardised (the International Commission on Radiation Units (ICRU)) (standard, level of evidence: A).After breast-conserving surgery, breast radiotherapy should always be performed, using a minimum dose of 50\xE2\x80\x89Gy in 25 fractions (standard, level of evidence: A). Breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery significantly reduces the risk of local recurrence irrespective of the initial disease stage (standard, level of evidence: A). In women under 50 years old, a boost should be administered routinely to the tumour bed even when the margins are clear (standard, level of evidence: B). Guidelines from an expert committee of the French Society of Oncological Radiotherapy (SFRO, 1991) cover the choice of target volume for irradiation following breast-conserving surgery. After mastectomy, the benefit from chest wall radiotherapy is greater in patients with the highest number of risk factors (standard, level of evidence: A).Irradiation of the internal mammary lymph nodes is indicated in all cases of axillary lymph node involvement (standard, level of evidence: B1) and when the tumour is medial or central (standard, expert agreement). Irradiation of the infra- and supraclavicular lymph nodes is indicated in the presence of axillary lymph node involvement (standard, level of evidence: B1). The omission of lymph node irradiation, as defined above, is only justified in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (standard, expert agreement).The choice of immediate breast reconstruction should not jeopardise the optimal use of locoregional radiotherapy and systemic treatment (recommendation). After axillary dissection, radiotherapy to the axilla should be avoided as much as possible because of the increased risk of locoregional complications (standard, level of evidence: C).ChemotherapyAnthracycline-containing polychemotherapy is currently the most commonly used regimen in France and is more efficacious than the CMF regimen: cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (5-FU) (standard, level of evidence: A). This is supported by the conclusions from the NIH consensus conference (NIH, 2000).Adjuvant chemotherapy improves progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with node-positive breast cancer and in certain patients without node involvement. Premenopausal women seem to benefit more than menopausal women.Doxorubicin, epirubicin, 5-FU, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate used in combination every 3\xE2\x80\x934 weeks, with a maximum of six cycles, is the reference treatment. The optimal number of cycles (four to six cycles) is unknown. Chemotherapy should be started promptly. The efficacy of perioperative chemotherapy has not been clearly proved, and should only be undertaken in the setting of a randomised clinical trial. High-dose chemotherapy, with or without stem cell infusion, is under evaluation and cannot be considered as a therapeutic standard. The optimal dose for epirubicin remains to be determined. Taxanes have not yet been shown to offer any benefit as adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment.Induction or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an option in operable breast cancer where first-line breast-conserving surgery is not possible, in the absence of multifocal lesions, and where the patient would prefer breast conservation (option). Compared with adjuvant therapy, induction or neoadjuvant therapy has no effect on survival but has been shown to avoid mastectomy in more than 50% of women. The risk of local recurrence is higher than with a primary mastectomy and the possibility of breast-conserving surgery is reduced. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, locoregional treatment should be performed in the same manner as that used for first-line locoregional treatment (standard).In premenopausal women, the combination of hormone therapy with adjuvant chemotherapy does not lead to a significant improvement in global survival or progression-free survival. This may be due to the low number of young women treated with tamoxifen and/or the lack of stratification for hormone receptor status in previous studies (standard, level of evidence: A). However, the practice was recommended in November 2000 by the NIH consensus conference (NIH, 2000).Hormone therapyTreatment with adjuvant tamoxifen is beneficial, despite its side effects, irrespective of the patients\xE2\x80\x99 age, if the tumour expresses oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). Tamoxifen should not be prescribed to women with tumours that do not express oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). The optimal duration for adjuvant hormone therapy with tamoxifen is 5 years at a dose of 20\xE2\x80\x89mg\xE2\x80\x89day\xE2\x88\x921 (standard, level of evidence: A). Patients treated with tamoxifen should have regular gynaecological clinical examinations (recommendation, expert agreement). Additional examinations are not necessary in the absence of symptoms.Neoadjuvant treatment with antioestrogens can be used in elderly women with slowly evolving hormone-sensitive tumours (option, level of evidence: B1). This should be followed when possible by optimal locoregional treatment (option, expert agreement). At present, antioestrogens cannot be considered as standard neoadjuvant treatment for initially operable tumours.Hormone therapy can be administered for different reasons, depending on the patients\xE2\x80\x99 age:\\nsuppression of ovarian function in women with ovarian activity and/or as an antioestrogen,antioestrogenic therapy in postmenopausal women.In postmenopausal women, the combination of chemotherapy with an antioestrogen significantly improves progression-free survival and overall survival (standard, level of evidence: A). The ratio of efficacy (overall or recurrence-free survival) and risk (toxicity) should be considered when taking the decision to prescribe this combination. The efficacy/risk ratio favours treatment in women with major metastatic risk factors (recommendation, expert agreement).Other hormone therapy (progestogens, aromatase inhibitors) should not be considered as adjuvant treatments except in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (standard).Breast reconstruction and additional treatmentsWhen mastectomy is necessary to obtain local control and the patient would prefer immediate breast reconstruction, multidisciplinary consultation is essential to assess the need for locoregional (irradiation) or systemic (chemotherapy or hormone therapy) treatment. Breast reconstruction is not a cancer treatment but is an integral component of breast cancer care (standard). It can be performed immediately or be delayed, but should never interfere with the administration of other treatments (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) (standard). Poor prognosis is not a contraindication for breast reconstruction (standard). However, the patient's performance status and/or a high risk of recurrence of the disease can be relative contraindications (standard). The patient should participate in the final decision (standard). There are three main techniques for reconstruction: submuscular inplant, latissimus dorsi flap or TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) pedicle flaps and microanastomosed free flaps (option).If the patient requires radiotherapy but wants immediate breast reconstruction, autologous tissue techniques should be used. A prosthesis can be irradiated but the patient should be informed about the potential risks, particularly that of substantial contraction as seen in about 50% of patients.TREATMENT STRATEGYThe patient should participate in her treatment decisions at every stage.Treatment evaluationTreatment evaluation involves both functional and aesthetic evaluation, consideration of possible side effects and the patients\xE2\x80\x99 quality of life (standard). Painful scarring (leading to limited mobility of the arm/shoulder) and lymphoedema are the most frequently observed complications after surgery. The aesthetic result depends on the quality of the surgery and radiotherapy technique (standard). Aesthetic problems do not occur following chemotherapy alone, but are observed when chemotherapy is used concomitantly with radiotherapy (standard). Visual analogue scales of well being are useful for assessing quality of life. Fatigue has a significant impact on quality of life and can be related to treatment and/or a depressive reaction. This should always be taken into consideration by the physician and its importance should not be underrated. Questionnaires exist for assessing fatigue and quality of life (standard).Locoregional treatmentSurgery and/or radiotherapy are used for the locoregional control of the disease.Management of impalpable tumoursThe therapeutic strategy for ductal carcinomas in situ is not covered in this document. The therapeutic management of impalpable tumours is often a stepwise process guided by the histological results of the previous intervention. The patient should be informed right from the start about the risks associated with repeated interventions.\\nFirst decisional step (Figure 3): This first step is diagnostic and potentially therapeutic and consists of a radiologically proven complete excision and histological analysis of the lesion (standard). In the absence of a palpable macroscopic lesion, a frozen section and primary axillary dissection should not be performed (recommendation, expert agreement). If microcalcifications are present, a mammogram should be performed 2 months after surgery (recommendation, expert agreement).Second decisional step: This step depends on the status of the surgical margins and the extent of the microcalcification before and/or after surgery.\\n\xE2\x97\x8B Microinvasive cancer (infiltrating component \xE2\xA9\xBD2\xE2\x80\x89mm): There is no specific data concerning the risk of progression of microinvasive cancers.

We propose that if normal tissues of the individual, including mammary epithelial cells, express lower levels of ATM owing to aberrantly increased gene-body methylation, then these individuals may be more susceptible to DNA mutations in those cells.The biggest risk factor for breast cancer and indeed most cancers is increasing age. The incidence of breast cancer in women doubles for every 10 years until menopause with a relative risk of >10-fold (36). An association between DNA methylation and increasing age has also been reported, for example increased DNA methylation variability in older twins compared with younger twins and increasing variability with increasing age in familial clusters (37,38). However, we have found that the association between the level of methylation at ATM mvp2b and increasing age is only associated in the bilateral breast cancer patients and not in controls. This suggests that the relationship between age and DNA methylation may be more dependent on the phenotype of the individuals, in this case cancer, and may be due to other predisposing environmental exposures that accumulate with age.One of the confounding factors which we cannot rule out in this study is the long-term effects of previous therapy in the patients that are not present in the controls. Future studies will need to investigate peripheral blood samples taken before the initiation of treatment preferably in prospectively collected cohort studies to rule out this possibility. However, if therapy accounted for an overall difference in genome-wide DNA methylation, the LINE1 assay for genome-wide methylation and the other unique sites tested (ATM mvp2a) would have detected this, which it did not. Another confounding factor is the effect of tissue-specific methylation. Although we have shown that in two healthy controls there is no evidence for cell-type-specific methylation of this locus, we cannot rule out this possibility in cancer patients. Therefore, this needs to be addressed in cancer patients.In summary, we have shown that inter-individual variability in gene-body methylation is associated with repetitive elements and that it is possible to identify regions of significant differences between bilateral breast cancer patients and controls that may be useful as additional surrogate markers for breast cancer risk. This research also demonstrates the correlation between the level of gene-body methylation and mRNA level of a single gene and highlights the potential for gene-body epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Finally, this work also supports the need to interrogate whole epigenomes, including repetitive elements, using tiling arrays or unbiased next-generation sequencing approaches to investigate the full complement of methylation variability across the genome.MATERIALS AND METHODSClinical sampleFor the microarray analysis, peripheral blood DNA samples from 14 women with bilateral breast cancer were compared with the DNA samples from 14 age- and ethnicity-matched controls. The cases were selected by being (i) BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation negative, confirmed clinically; (ii) metachronous tumours (separate sites) (iii) and those meet the bilateral case criteria set by Chaudary et al. (39), namely (a) subsequent tumour contains in situ component; (b) distinct histological types; (c) subsequent tumour has greater degree of differentiation; (d) no evidence of metastatic spread from ipsilateral tumour. These samples were collected with ethics approval from the Institute for Womens Health, Toronto, Canada. Peripheral blood DNA samples from a second set of 190 bilateral cases and 190 controls were obtained from the British Breast Cancer study (40,41). Bilateral breast cancer patients were ascertained through the English and Scottish cancer registries, controls were friends or non-blood relatives of breast cancer patients. Controls were age-matched to patients at the age at blood draw (within \xC2\xB1 2 months) and all patients and controls were Caucasians resident in the UK. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the South East Multicentre Research Ethics Committee.DNA methylation profiling using microarraysA custom oligonucleotide tiling array was designed to target the testable genomic regions (plus 100 kb flanking sequence) of genes, including breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 (82 kb), BRCA2 (86 kb), CHEK2 (57 kb) and ATM (143 kb) along with other genes that are known to be commonly methylated in breast cancer, including ESR1 (296 kb), SFN (1.3 kb), CDKN2A (27 kb), TP53 (19 kb), GSTP1 (2.8 kb), CDH1 (96 kb), CDH13 (1169 kb), HIC1 (4.0 kb), PGR (92 kb), SFRP1 (47 kb), MLH1 (57 kb), RARB (97 kb), HSD17B4 (90 kb). Arrays were designed by and performed by Nimblegen Inc. Specified regions were from UCSC HG17 with overlapping 50mer probes every 21 bp excluding repeat masked regions, and the probe set was replicated four times on the chip and averaged data were used for analysis. In addition to the 17 targeted genes, we also captured 26 genes and 12 partial genes which were peripherally targeted in the flanking regions by these tiling arrays (Supplementary Material, Table S1).The general principle of these DNA methylation arrays consists of hybridization of the unmethylated fraction of genomic DNA to the microarray containing oligonucleotides that represent the genomic region of interest. We performed the enrichment as described previously (42). Briefly, we used a cocktail of three methylation-sensitive enzymes (HpaII, AciI and Hin6I) to digest individuals genomic DNA and used ligation-mediated PCR to amplify products which were cleaned using Qiagen PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen, Canada), labelled with either Cy3 or Cy5 dyes and co-hybridized in matched pairs to the custom array. Hybridization intensity correlates with the DNA methylation status at the genomic locus homologous to each oligonucleotide on the array. MA2C was used for normalization, peak detection (using a cut-off of P < 0.001) and generation of MATScores for each probe (43).PyrosequencingDNA samples were bisulphite-converted using EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA) following the manufacturers protocol. Pyrosequencing of LINE1 elements was performed using the LINE1 assay (Biotage, Hertford, UK). All other pyrosequencing assays were designed using the PyroQ assay design software (primers in Supplementary Material, Table S3). All pyrosequencing assays for repetitive elements included at least one primer in a unique sequence outside of the repeat and followed by a unique nested primer pair for some amplicons to ensure specific amplification. A common tag was placed on either the forward or the reverse primer (depending on the strand to be sequenced), and a common universal biotinylated primer was used for all reactions as described previously (44). PCR was performed as described previously and cycling conditions included denaturation at 95\xC2\xB0C for 4 min, followed by 10 cycles of 94\xC2\xB0C for 15 s, touchdown from 60\xE2\x80\x9350\xC2\xB0C (\xE2\x88\x921 degree/cycle) for 15 s and 72\xC2\xB0C for 20 s, followed by a further 30 cycles at 50\xC2\xB0C annealing temperature. The second PCR used 2 \xC2\xB5l of a 1:10 dilution of the first PCR as template and the same cycling conditions (13). All products were confirmed to be single bands by agarose gel electrophoresis. Methylation values were calculated as an average of all CpG sites within each assay as determined by the Pyro Q-CpG Software (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden).Blood cell fractionationPeripheral blood was collected from two healthy female donors with informed consent. PBMCs were isolated using a standard Ficoll-paque protocol, and blood cell fractions were isolated using antibody-coated magnetic microbeads and MACS MS separation columns (cat: 130-042-201) following the manufacturers protocol (Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, UK). Briefly, 5\xE2\x80\x9310 million PBMCs were incubated with each of the antibody-coated beads for B-cells (CD19, cat: 130-050-301), T-cells (CD2, cat: 130-091-114) or monocytes (CD14, cat: 130-050-201). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole PBMCs and each cell-specific population. Bisulphite conversion and pyrosequencing were performed as described.Cancer cell linesDNA was extracted from 62 cell lines from brain (n = 7), breast (n = 5), colon (n = 5), leukaemia (n = 5), lymphoma (n = 9), sarcoma (n = 15) and others (n = 16). A full list of cell line names is included in Supplementary Material, Table S4. Bisulphite conversion and pyrosequencing were performed as described.Quantitative RT\xE2\x80\x93PCRQuantitative RT\xE2\x80\x93PCR was performed for ATM using an Eppendorf Mastercycler with the following primer pairs: ATM_F (5\xE2\x80\xB2-tgctcatacagcaggccata-3\xE2\x80\xB2) with ATM_R (5\xE2\x80\xB2-aaggctgaatgaaagggtaattc-3\xE2\x80\xB2) and GAPDH_F (5\xE2\x80\xB2-ggagtcaacggatttggtcgta-3\xE2\x80\xB2) with GAPDH_R (5\xE2\x80\xB2-ggcaacaatatccactttaccagagt-3\xE2\x80\xB2). The reaction mix contained 1\xC3\x97 SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and 0.5 \xC2\xB5m of each forward and reverse primers in a volume of 30 \xC2\xB5l. PCR cycling consisted of 95\xC2\xB0C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95\xC2\xB0C for 30 s, 60\xC2\xB0C for 60 s, followed by a meltcurve analysis. Fold-change in expression was calculated by \xCE\x94\xCE\x94Ct normalized to GAPDH for each sample and normalizing each of the cell lines to the cell line SKBR3.Statistical analysisThe majority of statistical analysis in this study was performed using various R packages as described earlier. The simulated peak distributions were determined by randomly placing single peaks across the same tiled region and calculating the distances to the real repetitive elements and repeating 10 000 times.

Hormone therapy with tamoxifen can be given if the tumour is positive (or unknown) for oestrogen receptors (option) (Figure 19Figure 19Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible\xE2\x80\x93local treatment after neoadjuvant treatment.).Adjuvant therapy after first-line radiotherapyThe size of the initial lesion may justify the use of adjuvant medical therapy (recommendation) (Figure 20Figure 20Palpable tumour, breast-conserving surgery not possible\xE2\x80\x93local treatment after neoadjuvant radiotherapy.).FOLLOW-UPFollow-up should focus on the evaluation of the treatment results, screening for relapse, treatment of side effects and psychosocial and professional rehabilitation (Figure 21Figure 21Standard follow-up.). This requires a multidisciplinary approach.Follow-up of the conserved breastClinical examination should be performed 4 months after treatment to assess treatment toxicity (standard). Clinical follow-up should then be repeated every 6 months for 5 years and then yearly for 10 years (standard). Routine follow-up should be continued after 10 years, but the timing can be adjusted depending on the risk of local recurrence (option). An annual mammogram should be performed starting 6 months after treatment (standard).Follow-up of the chest and lymph node areasRoutine clinical examination forms the basis of follow-up for the thoracic wall and the lymph node areas after treatment for breast cancer.Follow-up of the contralateral breastClinical examination and a mammogram should be performed at the same frequency as above for the follow-up of the conserved breast (standard, expert agreement).General follow-up after treatment of patients in complete remissionHistory taking and clinical examination form the basis of follow-up (standard). In the absence of symptoms or signs, a routine screen for metastases is not indicated (standard, level of evidence: A). If a metastasis is found, the patient should undergo a full work-up (recommendation, expert agreement). The frequency of general clinical follow-up is the same as that for locoregional follow-up (recommendation, expert agreement).Rehabilitation after treatment for breast cancerRehabilitation should start before treatment with clear specific information about possible post-treatment complications and how they can be prevented and/or managed (standard). Functional problems of arm or shoulder movement require early physiotherapy (standard). Lymphoedema can be treated with physical methods and systemic therapy (recommendation). Coumarin is no longer indicated because of its toxicity and lack of efficacy (standard).To avoid weight gain, dietary advice should be provided routinely (recommendation). Sexual problems should be evaluated and treated (recommendation). The need for contraception and family planning advice should be discussed individually taking into consideration each patient's preference (recommendation).Hormone replacement treatment for postmenopausal symptoms should not be prescribed after treatment for breast cancer, except in specific cases. The prescription of hormone replacement treatment after breast cancer is being evaluated prospectively. Nonhormonal treatments exist for the various symptoms (recommendation).Psychological support may well be required at some stage during the management process (option). Social support, to strengthen the psychological support, should be provided routinely to help patients and their families (option). Patient rehabilitation groups can contribute to the psychosocial support of patients (option).Management of patients with recurrent diseaseManagement of local recurrence after breast-conserving treatment for breast cancerLocal recurrence should be treated with surgery. Radiotherapy should not be considered except in specific cases (standard). The standard treatment is a simple total mastectomy (standard). Immediate reconstruction can be considered (option). If oestrogen receptors are present, additional hormone therapy is recommended (recommendation).Breast-conserving surgery can only be considered if the patient refuses mastectomy or if mastectomy is technically impossible. In this case, the patient should be informed of the high risk of recurrent disease (recommendation). As the efficacy of additional chemotherapy is unknown, this should only be considered in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (recommendation, expert agreement).Management of uncontrolled, isolated local recurrence (inflammatory or locally advanced tumour)There is no standard (standard). Chemotherapy can be considered, followed if possible, by local treatment that may or may not be curative (options). Local treatment (surgery and/or radiotherapy) for symptom control can also be considered (option).Chemotherapy is appropriate for an inflammatory recurrence. Radiotherapy can be considered if there are contraindications for chemotherapy (option). When possible, mastectomy should be performed for a locally advanced recurrence (option). If this is not possible, chemotherapy or radiotherapy should be given with the aim of making the lesion operable (option). Irrespective of the treatments administered, the indications for additional medical treatment will be the same as those for potentially curable isolated recurrences (recommendation, expert agreement).\",\"id\":\"0db6af7a-bf29-43a5-b845-f7c660b7c021\",\"_version_\":1534947704183980032},{\"nlmTa\":\"Hered Cancer Clin Pract\",\"all\":[\"Hered Cancer Clin Pract\",\"1731-2302\",\"2008-6-15\",\"BioMed Central\",\"\",\"19804604\",\"2735784\",\"Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\",\"6\",\"2\",\"88\",\"98\"],\"ppub\":\"1731-2302\",\"epub\":\"2008-6-15\",\"publisherName\":\"BioMed Central\",\"publisherLoc\":\"\",\"pmid\":19804604,\"pmc\":2735784,\"articleTitle\":\"Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\",\"volume\":6,\"issue\":2,\"fpage\":88,\"lpage\":98,\"body\":\"Familial breast cancer was first recognized in the Roman medical literature of 100 AD [1]. The first documentation of familial clustering of breast cancer in modern times was published by Broca, who reported 10 cases of breast cancer in 4 generations of his wife's family [2]. In the middle of the nineteen nineties it was proven at the molecular level that a substantial number of breast and ovarian cancers has hereditary monogenic aetiology [3,4]. Evaluation of frequency of pedigree-clinical signs characteristic for strong aggregations of breast/ovarian cancers among consecutive cases of cancers of these organs as well as analyses of cancer incidence in monozygotic twins indicate that about 30% of breast and ovarian cancers develop because of a strong genetic predisposition [5]. In other breast/ovarian cancers the significance of genetic factors was underestimated. However, recently it has been possible to show the characteristic constitutional background influencing development of cancer also in patients with sporadic neoplasms. Therefore now scientists think that in almost all patients with cancer a certain genetic background should be detectable, although influencing cancer risk to a various degree. Genetic abnormalities strongly related to cancer are called high risk

Most frequently strong genetic predisposition to breast/ovarian cancers are related to mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and most often it appears as syndromes of hereditary breast cancer -site-specific (HBC-ss), hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) and hereditary ovarian cancer (HOC).In family members of families with HBC-ss syndrome only breast cancers but not ovarian cancers are observed. In HBOC syndrome families both breast and ovarian cancers are diagnosed, and in HOC syndrome only ovarian but not breast cancers are detected. Operational clinical-pedigree criteria which we use in order to diagnose \\\"definitively\\\" or \\\"with high probability\\\" the discussed syndromes are summarized in Table 1. In the vast majority of cancer cases related to moderate risk genes family history is negative. HBC-ss, HBOC and HOC syndromes are clinically and molecularly heterogeneous. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most frequent cause of these syndromes.Table 1Pedigree-clinical diagnostic criteria of HBC-ss, HBOC and HOC syndromes [6]Number of breast or ovarian cancer cases in family:A - 3 (definitive diagnosis)\xE2\x80\x831) At least 3 relatives affected with breast or ovarian cancer diagnosed at any ageB - 2 (highly probable diagnosis)\xE2\x80\x831) 2 breast or ovarian cancer cases among first degree relatives (or second degree through male line)\xE2\x80\x832) 1 breast cancer and 1 ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age among first degree relatives (or second degree through male line)C - 1 (highly probable diagnosis)\xE2\x80\x831) Breast cancer diagnosed below 40 years of age\xE2\x80\x832) Bilateral breast cancer\xE2\x80\x833) Medullary or atypical medullary breast cancer\xE2\x80\x834) Breast and ovarian cancer in the same person\xE2\x80\x835) Breast cancer in maleBRCA1 syndromeIn this syndrome women carry a germline mutation in the BRCA1 gene. Carriers of a BRCA1 mutation have approximately 50-80% lifetime risk of breast cancer and 40% risk of ovarian cancer [7]. We estimate that these risks are 66% for breast cancer and 44% for ovarian cancer in the Polish population (Table 2). Both risks appear to be dependent on the type and localization of the mutation [8-10]. Our findings suggest that the risk of breast cancer in women with 5382insC is two times higher than in women with 4153delA.Table 2Risk of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers in Poland [8]A. Cumulated risk of breast cancerAge<304050607075Cumulated risk (%)1.66.53040.550.566B. Cumulated risk of ovarian cancerAge<304050607075Cumulated risk (%)13.512304144Incomplete penetrance of BRCA1 suggests that other factors, genetic and non-genetic modifiers, are important in carcinogenesis in the mutation carriers. The risk of ovarian cancer is modified by VNTR locus for HRAS 1 and is increased 2-fold in BRCA1 carriers harbouring one or two rare alleles of HRAS 1 [11]. We reported that the 135G>C variant in the RAD51 gene is strongly protective (OR = 0.5) against both ovarian and breast cancer [12,13].Carriers of a BRCA1 mutation are also at about 10% lifetime risk of fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers [14]. These data about the frequency of ovarian cancer in BRCA1 carriers appear to reflect the combined frequency of ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers, because these tumours were diagnosed as ovarian cancers in the past, and because they share similar morphology and cause elevated levels of the marker CA 125.The risk of cancer at other sites may be increased in carriers of a BRCA1 mutation as well, but the evidence is controversial and needs further studies.Breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1 carriers have particular clinical characteristics. The mean age at onset of breast cancer is about 42-45 years [15,16] and of ovarian cancer is about 54 years [17,18]. 18-32% of breast cancers are bilateral [19,20]. These are rapidly growing tumours: >90% of cases have G3 grade at the time of diagnosis and almost all ovarian cancers in women with a BRCA1 mutation are diagnosed in FIGO stage III\xC2\xB0/IV\xC2\xB0. Medullary, atypical medullary, ducal and oestrogen receptor negative (ER) breast tumours are common in BRCA1 carriers. BRCA1 mutation-positive tumours constitute about 10-15% of all ER-breast cancers [21-23]. Most carriers of a BRCA1 mutation report a positive family history of breast or ovarian cancer (Figure 1). However, 45% of BRCA1 carriers report a negative family history, mainly because of paternal inheritance and incomplete penetrance (Figure 3) [20].Figure 1Family with HOC syndrome and diagnosed constitutional 4153delA BRCA1 gene mutation.Figure 3Patient with ovarian cancer and detected 5382insC BRCA1 mutation from family with negative family history.Molecular diagnosis of constitutional BRCA1 mutationsThis topic has been described in detail in the section \\\"BRCA1 Test\\\".BRCA2 syndromePatients with this syndrome have a constitutional mutation in the BRCA2 gene [24]. According to literature data lifetime risk for BRCA2 carriers from families with definitive HBC-ss and HBOC is estimated at 31-56% for breast cancer and 11-27% for ovarian cancer [10,25-28]. Studies performed in 200 Polish families with strong aggregation of breast and/or ovarian cancers proved that mutations in the BRCA2 gene are rare, with a frequency of 4%. There are no studies on cumulated cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers from the Polish population. Most BRCA2 mutations from the Polish population probably slightly increase breast cancer risk. Studies performed in our centre showed that in families with aggregation of breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 50 and stomach cancer diagnosed in males before the age of 55, frequency of BRCA2 carriers is about 10-20% [29]. BRCA2 mutations are also related to a significantly increased although not precisely estimated risk of ovarian cancer and cancers of the digestive tract such as stomach, colon and pancreas in both females and males. Studies performed in our centre showed that BRCA2 mutations are detected with a frequency of 30% in families without breast cancer but with aggregation of ovarian cancer with stomach, colon or pancreatic cancer between first and second degree relatives [30]. BRCA2 studies performed on male breast cancer patients from the Pozna\xC5\x84 population showed that 15% of patients from this group are mutation carriers [31].Breast and ovarian cancers in families with BRCA2 mutations have characteristic features. Medium age of breast cancer is 52 and 53 in females and males, respectively, and 62 for ovarian cancer [31,32].Molecular diagnosis of BRCA2 mutationsUnlike for the BRCA1 gene, a founder effect for BRCA2 mutations was not observed with significant frequency in the Polish population [22]. It should be noted that \\\"de novo\\\" mutations are rare in these groups of genes; thus the presence of founder mutations in BRCA2 is probable. As yet BRCA2 mutations should be diagnosed individually for each family by full sequencing. Since the BRCA2 gene is large - about 70 genomic kbp - the cost of sequencing of this gene is high (around 1500 euro).In families with a detected marker of constitutional mutation the cost of analysis of two independently taken blood samples allowing exclusion or confirmation of carrier status among relatives is low - around 100 euro.BRCAX syndromeIn Poland in about 30% of families with definitively diagnosed HBC-ss and HBOC syndromes and in about 40% of families with HOC syndrome, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are not detected. In rare cases it is possible to diagnose one of the rare syndromes listed in Table 3. In these syndromes breast/ovarian cancers are observed with higher frequency. Many groups worldwide are trying to identify new genes causing BRCAX syndrome.Table 3Selected rare syndromes with increased risk of breast and/or ovarian cancerDiseaseClinical featuresGene mutation/InheritanceReferencesLi-Fraumeni syndromebreast cancers, sarcomas, brain tumours, leukaemia, renal gland cancerp53, high penetrance, AD17, 33Cowden diseasemultifocal mucoid skin abnormalities, benign proliferative abnormalities of different organs, thyroid cancers, breast/ovarian cancersPTEN, AD34, 35HNPCCcolon cancers, endometrial cancers, other organ cancers including breast and ovaryMSH2, MLH1, AD36Peutz-Jeghers syndromehyperpigmentation of the mouth, bowel polyps, colorectal cancers, small bowel cancers, gonadal tumours, breast cancersSTK11, AD37Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith (Z.

Using the Model-based Analysis of 2-Color Arrays (MA2C) algorithm, we were able to detect 181 significantly variable regions (P < 0.001) across the 28 individuals, which we have termed inter-individual MVPs. These included 143 intragenic, or gene-body, MVPs and 38 intergenic regions not associated with known gene promoters (Supplementary Material, Table S2). We observed intragenic methylation variability in each of the remaining targeted genes ATM, PGR, CDH1, CDH13, CHEK2, MLH1, RARB, HSD17B4, ESR1, SFRP1 and CDKN2A. Of all of the genes tested, we detected no significant intragenic methylation variability in six of the targeted genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, SFN, HIC1 and GSTP1 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2).Methylation variability is located in intragenic repetitive elementsAlthough the repetitive sequences themselves are not tiled, the enrichment of unmethylated genome can assess methylation status of the repetitive sequences by probing the unique sequences flanking the repeats (gaps in the tiling microarrays) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1B). To confirm the association of MVPs with repetitive elements, we have calculated the distance from the middle of each peak to the nearest repetitive element for each of the 181 identified loci. This analysis identified 80/181 (44%) of MVPs within 100 bp of the nearest repetitive element and 60% within 200 bp. This distribution is significantly closer to repetitive elements than can be expected by random chance (P = 7.39e\xE2\x80\x9307, Kolmogorov\xE2\x80\x93Smirnov test) (Fig.\xC2\xA01A). The distribution of repeat element type is not significantly different to the distribution throughout the genome. By aligning each gene at the transcription start sites (TSSs) and averaging the MATScores, we were able to generate a general picture of methylation variability over the first 10 kb of genes longer than 10 kb or across the first 5 kb of shorter genes. This reveals very low methylation variability over all gene promoters up to the TSS and a sharp increase in variability over the first 1 kb of intragenic sequence followed by periodic increase and decrease in variability every 2 kb (Fig.\xC2\xA01B).Figure\xC2\xA01.Methylation microarray analysis of 17 genes reveals methylation variability in repetitive elements. (A) The distance from each of the MVP to the nearest repetitive element was calculated for each of the 181 distinct MVPs revealing 44% of peaks within 100 bp of the nearest repetitive element. Random placement of 181 simulated MVP peaks reveals a distribution containing only 26% of peaks within 100 bp of the nearest repetitive element. Kolmogorov\xE2\x80\x93Smirnov test was used to determine the significance of the difference in distribution. (B) The smoothed average of MATScores (\xC2\xB12 SD in red) for genes aligned at the TSS reveals periodic increase in methylation variability across the first 10 kb (of genes >10 kb) or across the first 5 kb (of shorter genes, median 4.5 kb).Investigation of DNA methylation of ATMWe have performed a detailed validation of the MVPs within the targeted region surrounding one gene, ATM, which we have selected because it is known to contain germline mutations in familial breast cancer cases with a clear pathogenic role and it contains several intragenic MVPs associated with repetitive elements (Fig.\xC2\xA02A). We used bisulphite modification coupled with pyrosequencing assays to map methylated cytosines in the repetitive elements nearest to six MVPs in the targeted region surrounding ATM. We first analysed the 14 matched case\xE2\x80\x93control paired samples that we performed the microarray analysis on. Pair-wise comparison of methylation percentages confirmed the significant inter-individual variability in each of the loci identified by the microarray as exemplified by ATMmvp2a with 8/14 pairs significantly different (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank sum test) (Fig.\xC2\xA02B). Combined data from all of the 14 cases and controls revealed no statistically significant differences overall between patients and controls; however, the highest range of methylation across individuals were observed in the intragenic regions nearest the TSSs. The two most variable loci, ATMmvp1 and ATMmvp2, are both 4 kb downstream of the start sites of the genes NPAT and ATM, respectively (Fig.\xC2\xA02C). We detected no significant difference in genome-wide methylation as assessed by the pyrosequencing assay for LINE1; therefore, any differences detected are unlikely to be due to overall genome-wide methylation differences. Furthermore, in each of the 14 cases and controls, we detected no methylation of the ATM promoter CpG island in the peripheral blood DNA.Figure\xC2\xA02.Investigation of ATM gene methylation. (A) Methylation microarray data for the ATM gene locus. Seven methylation variable peaks were detected across the tiled region surrounding the ATM gene. Data are presented as a custom WIG file track on the UCSC genome browser. (B) Pair-wise comparison of ATM mvp2a methylation reveals increased methylation in 5/14 bilateral breast cancer patients (blue) compared with matched controls (yellow). Methylation of six CpG dinucleotides within the repetitive element mvp2a was determined by pyrosequencing. Pair-wise Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was used to determine statistical significance (# indicates P < 0.05). (C) DNA methylation analysis of MVPs reveals significant variability detected within the ATM gene. LINE 1 assay shows no significant differences in methylation of LINE1 repetitive elements in peripheral blood DNA of cases (blue) compared with controls (yellow). Methylation variability was detected in mvp1b, mvp2a, mvp2b, mvp3 and mvp4. Box and whisker plots represent median (centre line), inter-quartile range (box) and 95th percentiles (whisker), and samples outwith this range are represented as points.We performed a second stage of validation for the most variable loci, MVP2, within the ATM gene as well as the ATM CpG island and LINE1 assays in peripheral blood DNA from 190 bilateral breast cancer patients compared with 190 controls (Fig.\xC2\xA03). Again, we detected no significant difference between cases and controls in the LINE1 assay or the ATM CpG island. The LINE1 assay did, however, show inter-individual variability with genome-wide methylation values ranging from the lowest individual at 48% to the highest at 74% (median 56%). We did detect a significant increase in methylation of ATMmvp2b in the bilateral breast cancer patients (range 72.8\xE2\x80\x9398.4%, mean 91.4%) compared with control individuals (range 53\xE2\x80\x9398%, mean 89.8%) (P = 0.001686, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3). We have used an inter-quartile analysis of the ATM mvp2b methylation data to reveal a significant increase in methylation in cases in the highest quartile (P = 0.0011 using \xCF\x872 test), which is associated with a 3-fold increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio\xE2\x80\x94OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.78\xE2\x80\x935.86, P = 0.000083), compared with the lowest quartile (Table\xC2\xA01). We have analysed these data to identify whether the methylation status of this locus is associated with any phenotypic characteristics. We have investigated the age at blood draw (median 6.6 years after second diagnosis), age at first and second diagnoses and the time between diagnoses (Table\xC2\xA02). There was no association between the methylation level and tumour morphology, age at first full-term pregnancy, age at menarche, menopausal status, body mass index, weight, parity and the number of affected first-degree relatives (data not shown). Only the age and the age of diagnoses in the breast cancer patients were significantly associated with the methylation status (adjusted for multiple testing, P = 0.01035). Interestingly, even though the controls were age-matched with patients, age was not correlated with the methylation status in the controls (r = \xE2\x88\x920.1077, P = 0.07), only in the cases at blood draw (r = 0.242, P = 0.0004), at first diagnosis (r = 0.189, P = 0.0045) and at second diagnosis (r = 0.251, P = 0.0002) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4).Figure\xC2\xA03.Methylation of LINE1, ATM CpG island, mvp2a and mvp2b in 190 bilateral breast cancer cases compared with 190 controls.

(B) Pyrosequencing-based methylation analysis of 190 bilateral breast cancer cases compared with 190 matched controls reveals no methylation in the promoter CpG island and significant inter-individual methylation variability in the intronic mvp2a and mvp2b.

2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: illary node-positive breast cancer.64,69 To investigate the prognostic significance of HER2 overexpression, immunohistochemical staining for HER2 was performed on sections from paraffin blocks of 292 primary invasive breast cancers obtained from women enrolled in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project protocol B-06.70 A positive reaction indicative of HER2 overexpression was observed in 21% of their breast cancer samples. Patients with HER2 overexpression had a significantly worse overall survival (P = 0.0012) with twice the mortality rate of women without detectable HER2 expression.70 In multivariate analysis, detection of HER2 overexpression was the second most predictive independent variable for survival after nodal status. Overexpression of HER2 was more common among tumors of high nuclear grade (29%) than those of low nuclear grade (12%). The association of HER2 overexpression with decreased survival was evident only among women with tumors of low nuclear grade. In this subgroup, HER2 overexpression was associated with an approximately fivefold increase in mortality rate (P = 0.00001). Thus, the combined predictive value of HER2 overexpression and nuclear grade was evident regardless of lymph node status.71 Allred and colleagues71 evaluated HER2 expression using immunohistochemistry in 613 patients with node-negative breast cancer enrolled in the Intergroup Study 0011. In their study, patients were stratified into low-risk groups (n = 307) and high-risk groups (n = 306). Lowrisk patients were defined as having small (<3 cm), ER-positive tumors and were observed without additional treatment after initial surgery. High-risk patients had either ER-negative tumors or large (\xE2\x89\xA53 cm), ER-positive tumors; they were randomized to be observed (n = 146) or to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 160) after surgery. In their study, HER2 was overexpressed in 14.3% of all tumors combined, and overexpression was higher in invasive carcinomas associated with an extensive in situ component (21.5%) than in carcinomas without a significant noninvasive or in situ histological component (11.2%; P < 0.0001). When patients with low-risk lesions not containing a significant in situ component (n = 179) were analyzed, HER2 was a strong prognostic factor. Patients in this group with HER2-positive tumors had only a 40% DFS at 5 years, compared with more than 80% in patients with HER2-negative tumors (P < 0.0001).71Using cDNA microarrays, Perou and colleagues classified invasive breast carcinomas into five subtypes based on their distinct gene expression profile (Norway/Stanford dataset).72 These included a luminal epithelial cell phenotype (subtypes A and B), a basal epithelial cell type phenotype, a HER2(+) phenotype, and a group of cancers expressing a \xE2\x80\x98 normal-like\xE2\x80\x99 gene profile. Patients whose tumors exhibited the basal-like and HER2-positive subtypes had the worst survival rates, while those with the luminal epithelial type had improved survival rates.73HER2 expression is scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+, depending on the number of cells with membrane staining and on the intensity of the staining. If the tumor is 0 or 1+, it is considered HER2-negative. If the tumor is 2+ or 3+, it is considered HER-2-positive. The humanized monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin\xC2\xAE, Genentech, CA) is used for treatment of HER2-positive patients.68,74 Since HER2 is relatively uniformly overexpressed in human breast cancers (Fig. 2a), monoclonal antibodies have been developed to the extracellular domain to treat carcinomas overexpressing HER2. Trastuzumab is also approved for treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.75A randomized phase III trial of 469 women with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 expression demonstrated that chemotherapy plus trastuzumab was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P < 0.001), a higher rate of objective response (50 percent vs. 32 percent, P < 0.001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P < 0.001), a lower rate of death at 1 year (22 percent vs. 33 percent, P = 0.008), longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months; P = 0.01), and a 20% reduction in the risk of death.68 In a phase II study, HER2 status was measured weekly in women with HER2-normal and HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer given trastuzumab and paclitaxel. Efficacy was correlated with immunohistochemical and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay results.76 HER2 status was evaluated using four different immunohistochemical assays and FISH. Patients received a median of 25 weekly infusions (range, one to 85 infusions). The intent-to-treat response rate for all 95 patients enrolled was 56.8% (95% confidence interval, 47% to 67%). A response rate of 61.4% (4.5% complete response, 56.8% partial response) was observed in 88 fully assessable patients.76 In patients with HER2-overexpressing tumors, overall response rates ranged from 67% to 81% compared with 41% to 46% in patients with HER2-normal expression (ranges reflect the different assay methods used to assess HER2 status). Differences in response rates between patients with HER2-overexpressing tumors and those with normal HER2 expression were statistically significant for all assay methods, with CB11 and TAB250 antibodies and FISH having the strongest significance. Given the established efficacy of trastuzumab for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, the HER2 testing will continue to be used as a standard laboratory test in breast cancer clinics.p53The p53 tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17p13, has a regulatory function in the defense against various kinds of cancer, including breast cancer.77\xE2\x80\x9383 The p53 gene transcription is activated by genetic, environmental, and metabolic stimuli, which direct cells to different pathways including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. It plays a central role in sensing genotoxic and non-genotoxic stresses and transducing an anti-proliferative effect80,82 (Fig. 1). p53 is activated and regulated by post-translational modifications to both the N- and C-terminal regions (e.g. phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation) and binds as a tetramer to specific DNA sequences via a central DNA-binding core region. p53 exerts its primary biologic function by modulating the transcription of dozens of genes.81,84 In mice, loss of p53 is associated with multiple spontaneous tumors77 and p53-loss accelerates the appearance of mammary tumors in murine mammary tissue that also overexpresses Myc, HER2/neu, IGF1, and/or Wnt1.85,86 Inheritance of a p53 mutant allele causes the rare familial Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by multiple early-onset cancers, including breast cancer in women who survive childhood cancers. Germline mutations in ATM and CHEK2, which are involved in p53 activation, also increase susceptibility to breast cancer.87Twenty to 35% of sporadic cases of breast cancers harbor somatic mutations in p53, based primarily on sequencing of exons 5 through 8 (the DNA-binding core), where approximately 90% of mutations are found.78,88,89 A total of 2,274 mutations in breast cancers are listed in the p53 database maintained by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.90p53, when mutated, accumulates in the nucleus of neoplastic cells. Mutation of p53 is characterized by a common amino acid substitution resulting in a shift from an arginine (Arg) to a proline (Pro) at codon 72.91 Due to increased half-life and an altered conformational structure, the mutant form of p53 protein accumulates within malignant cells. Polymorphic variants have different biological properties; for example, the Arg/Arg genotype has been reported to induce apoptosis more effectively than the Pro/Pro genotype.92\xE2\x80\x9394The significance of p53 in carcinogenesis is manifested by the frequent genetic alterations in human cancers, found as mutations within the DNA binding domain and as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the loci of the gene. Several studies have reported LOH at codon 72 with preferential loss of the Pro allele both in breast cancer and other malignancies.93,95\xE2\x80\x9397 The p53 genotype, in addition to the LOH status of codon 72, influences the prognosis in cancer. Two groups have studied this polymorphism in relation to breast cancer prognosis; they found a reduced survival for homozygous carriers of the Pro allele,98,99 consistent with the idea that the Pro72 variant of p53 is less efficient in inducing apoptosis than the Arg 72 variant.Initial studies trying to elucidate the role of a mutated p53 gene in breast cancer prognosis were based on detecting p53 accumulation using immunohistochemistry. However, even in a meta-analysis of more than 9,000 breast cancer patients, the prognostic value of the p53 overexpression appeared weak.100 Conversely, sequencing studies have shown strong prognostic significance of p53 mutations in breast cancer. In one study where p53 mutations from 1,794 European patients with at least 10 years of follow-up were analyzed, mutations in p53 exons 5 through 8 were more common in ductal and medullary tumors with an aggressive phenotype (i.e. high grade, large size, node-positive cases, and low hormone receptor content), and in women less than 60 years old. Furthermore, the presence of a mutation conferred an overall 2.27-fold increased relative risk of breast cancer-specific mortality, independently of other known prognostic markers (e.g. tumor size, node status, and ER/PR expression).101 In a comprehensive meta-analysis of 16 studies including over 3,500 patients,102 the relative hazard of dying of breast cancer for unselected patients with a p53 mutation in their tumor was 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.7\xE2\x80\x932.5). For nodenegative patients the relative hazard was 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.2\xE2\x80\x932.3), and for node-positive patients
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: n D1 and breast cancer outcome has been controversial, with studies reporting both positive and negative findings.141\xE2\x80\x93143 Subgroup analyses within relatively few patients have also hampered definitive conclusions. In addition, other molecules in the RB pathway have not been measured simultaneously. In spite of these limitations, there appears to be a relationship between cyclin D1 gene amplification and poor disease outcome in ER-positive patients.144\xE2\x80\x93146 In contrast, cyclin D1 protein expression is associated with a good prognosis in some studies,141,147 potentially as a consequence of its positive relationship with ER expression and negative relationship with RB mutations. However, other studies failed to confirm this relationship.142,148Interpretation is further complicated by suggestions that under some circumstances, cyclin D1 overexpression may worsen clinical outcome by conferring resistance to endocrine treatments.149,150 Consistent with this possibility, one small clinical study suggested that the duration of response to tamoxifen was significantly longer in ER-positive patients with low cyclin D1 than those with high cyclin D1.150 Resolution of these issues must await more detailed analysis of cyclin D1 expression and patient outcomes in the context of prospective randomized clinical trials.The CCND1 locus encodes two gene products, cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b, which have discrete mechanisms of regulation and impact on cell behavior.151,152 A polymorphism at nucleotide 870 in the CCND1 gene, rs603965, influences the relative production of the encoded proteins and can reveal increased risk for tumor development. Millar et al153 studied the impact of both the G/A870 polymorphism and cyclin D1b protein production on breast cancer risk, disease phenotype and patient outcome. In a large multiethnic case-control study, the G/A870 polymorphism conferred no significant risk for breast cancer overall, by stage or ER status. However, the cyclin D1b protein was upregulated in breast cancer, independent of cyclin D1a levels, and exhibited heterogeneous levels in breast cancer specimens. High cyclin D1a expression inversely correlated with the Ki67 proliferation marker, but was not associated with clinical outcome. In contrast, elevated cyclin D1b expression was independently associated with adverse outcomes, including recurrence, distant metastasis, and decreased survival.153 Cyclin D1b overexpression was particularly associated with poor outcome in ER-negative breast cancer. Thus, specific cyclin D1 isoforms are associated with discrete forms of breast cancer and high cyclin D1b protein levels hold prognostic potential.Cyclin D2 is more ubiquitously expressed in tissues than cyclin D1. Cyclin D2 is expressed in normal human mammary epithelial cells, but interestingly, its overexpression is rare in breast cancers.154,155 This is due to promoter hypermethylation in most cases.156 Its functional significance, if any, in breast oncogenesis has yet to be determined, although potential roles of cyclin D2 in terminal differentiation and senescence of human breast epithelium have been proposed. Indeed, MMTV-cyclin D2 mice show increased proliferation of mammary glands in pregnant females, but alveolar differentiation is partially or completely inhibited.157 In one report, cyclin D3 was overexpressed in breast cancers, but there are limited data on its relationship to the phenotype of breast cancer and prognosis of patients.158 Keyomarsi et al showed that the absence of cyclin D1 or cyclin D3 protein expression was associated with improved disease-specific and overall survival, but the correlations were less striking than those for cyclin E.159Cyclin ECyclin E is the limiting factor for G1 phase progression and S phase entry. The cyclin E gene is a target of E2Fs and the protein associates with Cdk2 and activates its kinase activity shortly before entry of cells into the S phase113,115,129 (Fig. 1). The restriction point \xE2\x80\x9CR\xE2\x80\x9D at the transition between G1- and S-phases of the cell cycle has been recognized as the endpoint of regulatory pathways that are critical for growth control, and thus also for prevention of excessive or unrestricted growth. Deregulation of these pathways\xE2\x80\x94or the deletion or overexpression of particular factors that are substantial for these pathways\xE2\x80\x94 have been linked to malignant transformation of cells and the development of cancer. While there is evidence of the importance of cyclin D1 in mammary tumorigenesis,160 the role of cyclin E in this respect has only recently been established. Cyclin E is expressed in supra-physiological levels in many human cancers and its genomic locus (19q12-q13) is frequently amplified.161,162 High levels of cyclin E and low levels of the G1-specific cell cycle inhibitor p27KIP1 exhibit a good correlation.159,163\xE2\x80\x93169 Another clue for the importance of cyclin E in breast carcinoma is the finding of centrosome amplifications in these tumors, which could pave the way for genomic instability.170\xE2\x80\x93172Two proteins codified by two different genes but with high homology, called cyclin E1 (formerly cyclin E) and cyclin E2 have been identified.173\xE2\x80\x93177 Cyclin E2, like cyclin E1, associates with Cdk2 and activates its kinase activity at the G1/S boundary.176 Cyclin E2 shares 47% overall similarity to cyclin E1; whether its structural features outside the conserved regions reveal unique functions is unknown.176Increased expression of cyclin E1 has been reported in approximately 40% of breast cancer cases,159,178,179 and of cyclin E2 in 38% of primary ER-negative breast cancers.176 Elevated levels of both cyclins were more frequently found in ER-negative than in ER-positive tumors.176 The prognostic role of cyclin E (E1) has been retrospectively evaluated in a number of studies.180\xE2\x80\x93187 Keyomarsi et al found that the overexpression of the cyclin E protein was accompanied by the appearance of low molecular weight (LMW) isoforms, and both were a reliable prognostic marker in stage I\xE2\x80\x93III breast cancer patients. In fact, the hazard ratio for death due to breast cancer in patients with high levels of cyclin E was higher than associated with any other biological marker examined (seven times higher than the hazard ratio associated with lymph node metastases). Of note, all node-negative patients with high levels of cyclin E (12 out of 114) died of breast cancer. In some studies, a correlation between cyclin E and high histological grade181,182,184,186 or ER negativity180,187 has been reported, while an inverse correlation with p27KIP1 was observed in a study where both factors were prognostic.168To study the oncogenic potential of the LMW forms of cyclin E in breast carcinogenesis, transgenic mice expressing full-length cyclin E alone, full-length and the EL4 isoforms, or the EL2/3 isoforms of cyclin E were generated under the control of MMTVLTR.188,189 Both primary mammary tumor formation and metastasis were markedly enhanced in LMW cyclin E-transgenic mice. LMW cyclin E overexpression in mammary epithelial cells of mice was sufficient to induce mammary carcinomas in 34 of 124 (27%) animals compared with 7 of 67 (10%) mice expressing only the full-length cyclin E, suggesting higher oncogenic activity of the LMW form.188 In addition, metastasis was more frequently found in LMW cyclin E tumor-bearing animals compared with tumors in mice with the full-length cyclin E background (P < 0.05). They also reported that LMW cyclin E overexpression selected for inactivation of p53 by LOH and frequent inactivation of p19Arf, canceling the protective checkpoint function of the Arf-p53 pathway and accelerating progression to mammary carcinomas.188,189BRCA1 and BRCA2Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 located in chromosome 17q21 and 13q13, respectively, are involved in breast carcinogenesis.190 The gene was subsequently cloned and found to be novel, containing an aminoterminal, zinc- and DNA-binding \xE2\x80\x9Cring finger\xE2\x80\x9D motif; a carboxyl-terminal BCRT domain; and a nuclear localization sequence. Interestingly, mutations are particularly prevalent in breast cancers of Ashkenazi Jewish women and other select populations,191 but some families carrying BRCA mutations have few afflicted members. In other studies comparing different carrier populations, BRCA1 mutations were reported (but rarely) in women with no familial association of the disease.192 BRCA1 mutations were also associated with shorter survival (63% vs. 91%, P = 0.04) in a study of 249 European patients (36 patients with BRCA1 mutations, 8 with BRCA2 mutations, and 205 controls).193 These studies emphasize the variable penetrance of inherited risk conferred by this gene.Although mutations in the BRCA1 gene are widely prevalent in patients with familial breast and ovarian cancer, mutations are rarely detected in sporadic breast cancers. BRCA2 is associated with familial cancers of the female and male breast and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries. Its gene shares homology with BRCA1, and its encoded protein has similar biochemical functions to BRCA1. However, BRCA2 mutation appears less involved in risk of ovarian cancer compared to BRCA1. Mutations of BRCA2 confer risk of male breast cancer and (to a more limited extent) several other cancers, such as prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-Hodgkin\xE2\x80\x99s lymphoma, basal cell carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, and fallopian tube tumors.Current studies using CGH and cDNA microarray analysis suggest a distinct signature of chromosome gains and losses and gene expression for the different classes of familial breast cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX) compared to sporadic breast cancers.194 BRCA1 appears to interact with the p53 protein (leading to induction of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21Cip1/WAF1; Fig. 1)195 directly, with the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, with the transcription f
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]:  the relative hazard was 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.7\xE2\x80\x933.9).This and later studies have confirmed that p53 mutations are associated with worse overall and disease-free survival in breast cancer cases, and this effect is independent of other risk factors. In several studies, the presence of a p53 mutation was the single, most powerful prognostic indicator for both recurrence and death. Whether the prognostic significance of all types of mutations is the same, is still controversial. Borresen et al103 reported that patients with mutations affecting or disrupting the zinc-binding domains L2 and L3 (p53 codons 163\xE2\x80\x93195 and 236\xE2\x80\x93251) have a worse prognosis than patients with mutations elsewhere. In a later study, mutations affecting amino acids directly involved in DNA-binding\xE2\x80\x94many in the zinc binding domain\xE2\x80\x94were related with the poorest prognosis.104 These findings were confirmed in a different study, where patients with missense mutations affecting DNA-binding or zinc-binding domains had a very aggressive phenotype with a short survival.105 Another group reported that the prognosis for mutations in the conserved regions II and V was worse than for mutations in the conserved regions III and IV and non-conserved regions.106 The poor prognosis for patients with specific p53 mutations could mean that they have a gain-of-function effect or a particularly strong dominant-negative phenotype.107Recent reports have described the detection of tumor-specific DNA circulating in plasma from breast cancer patients. Garcia et al108 examined plasma DNA from the breast cancer patients; in 61 of the 142 patients, with an average 58 months of follow-up, similar molecular signatures in tumor and plasma DNA was detected. For patients with tumor DNA in their plasma, the hazard ratio for recurrence was 2.5. Disease-free survival was 37% for positive patients and 75% for negative patients (P = 0.005). Among the 35 recurrences observed, 25 were positive for tumor plasma DNA and 10 were negative, (P < 0.001). These results indicate that tumor plasma DNA at diagnosis can serve as a prognostic marker of the overall survival of breast cancer patients. Further work is required to determine the role of the p53 mutations in plasma DNA in breast cancer prognosis.Although both HER2 overexpression and p53 mutations are important prognostic factors for breast cancer, only a few reports have described the signaling cascades that link HER2 and p53. It was reported that HER2 overexpression in p53 wild-type human ovarian carcinoma cell line induced apoptosis shortly after transfection, while HER2 expression was associated with proliferation in cells with mutated p53.109 It was also reported that HER2/neu induces p53 ubiquitination via Akt-mediated Mdm2 phosphorylation and inactivates p53 in Arf-deficient cells.110 Thus, both ARF and p53 are important genetic determinants in susceptibility to HER2 overexpression in breast cancer. Further experiments should be conducted to characterize the signaling pathway between HER2 and ARF/p53.ARFThe INK4a/ARF locus encodes two unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, which participate in the two main cell-cycle control pathways, p16INK4a-Rb and p14ARF-p53111\xE2\x80\x93115 (Fig. 1). p14ARF (p19Arf in mice), is a 14 kDa (19 kDa) protein predominantly localized in the nucleolus. It blocks the cell cycle in both G1 and G2 phases and inhibits the growth of incipient cancer cells by indirectly activating p53. It also inhibits ribosomal RNA processing and interacts with topoisomerase I.116 Arf triggers sumoylation of many cellular proteins, including Mdm2 and nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), with which p19Arf physically interacts in vivo. This occurs equally well in cells expressing or lacking functional p53.117 Thus, Arf\xE2\x80\x99s p53-independent effects on gene expression and tumor suppression might depend on Arf-induced sumoylation.117Methylation of CpG promoter islands has been described as a mechanism of gene silencing. Exon 1 of the p16INK4a gene and the p14ARF promoter gene reside within CpG islands. Therefore, both can become methylated de novo and silenced. However, genetic alterations that selectively inactivate p14ARF have been poorly analyzed in breast cancer. One comprehensive analysis of the inactivation mechanisms (mutation, homozygous and hemizygous deletion, and promoter hypermethylation) in 100 primary breast carcinomas118,119 used RT-PCR to document variable expression of the p14ARF transcript, with 17% demonstrating overexpression and 26% demonstrating decreased expression. No detectable alterations were observed in most cases with overexpressed p14ARF mRNA, but 77% of tumors with decreased expression had at least one of these genetic/epigenetic alterations. A different group analyzed the methylation status of p16INK4a and p14ARF by methylation-specific PCR in 100 breast, 95 colon and 27 bladder carcinomas. 120 Clinicopathological parameters were obtained from the medical records of the patients, and p14ARF showed a higher rate of hypermethylation than p16INK4a in all three tumor types.120 Sharma et al also found promoter hypermethylation of p14ARF in serum and tumor DNA from breast cancer patients. Aberrant methylation was significantly correlated with poor prognosis when analyzed with clinicopathological parameters of the breast tumor subtypes.121 Thus, both p16INK4a and p14ARF hypermethylation may be useful markers to predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients.TBX2/3T-box proteins contain a T-domain that affects dimerization and DNA binding. TBX2 belongs to the Tbx subfamily of T-box transcription factors.122,123 Other subfamilies of T-box genes are Brachyury, T-brain1, Tbx1 and Tbx6. TBX2, TBX3, TBX4 and TBX5 belong to the TBX2 subfamily. TBX2 and TBX3 are the only mammalian T-box factors with reported transcriptional repressor functions. Tbx2 and Tbx3 are closely related T-box proteins that have been implicated in tissue development in different sites, including the mammary gland. TBX3 is required for normal mammary development in mouse models and in patients with ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS).123 TBX2 and TBX3 also have been implicated in tumor development through downregulation of the ARF tumor suppressor and an associated bypass of senescence.124,125 Overexpression of Bmi1, Pokemon, and Twist also contribute to tumor formation by repressing the INK4a/ARF locus.126 The TBX2 gene encoding a key developmental transcription factor is amplified and overexpressed in BRCA1 and BRCA2-mutated breast tumors.127 However, it is not known how Tbx2 mediates its repressive effect, nor whether endogenous Tbx2 or Tbx3 have a similar anti-senescence function in transformed cells. This is a particularly important question because the loss of CDKN2 A in many human cancers would, in principle, bypass the requirement for Tbx2/3-mediated repression of ARF in suppressing senescence (Fig. 1).It has been reported that TBX2 is amplified in 8.6 to 21.6 % of sporadic human breast carcinomas, where the protein is overexpressed.122 A representative picture of TBX2 overexpression in human breast cancer is shown in Figure 2c. Ectopic expression of Tbx2 results in DNA polyploidy and cisplatin resistance. 128 Thus, overexpression of Tbx2 contributes to breast carcinogenesis by accelerating cell proliferation, changing DNA ploidy, and making cells resistant to chemotherapy. More studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of TBX2/3 overexpression in breast cancer.Cyclin D1D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, and D3) are other key regulator proteins of the G1 phase progression.113,115,129,130 There are three cyclins in this family with differential effects on the development of the normal mammary gland.131 The cyclin D1 protein is synthesized in response to growth factors; its levels peak in the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle. The association of cyclin D1 to Cdk is crucial to drive cells to the restriction point where the cell is committed to divide.129,130 D-type cyclins bind to Cdks 4 and 6 and phosphorylate downstream substrates, mainly pRb, and these complexes can also sequester Cdk inhibitors (p21Cip1 and p27 Kip1) in the G1/S transition115,129,130 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, cyclin D1, the first member identified, can have Cdk-independent functions and can act as a co-factor for ER\xCE\xB1 independently of the ligand.57,58 D-type cyclins inhibit the activity of the Dmp1 transcription factor, which is a critical regulator of the Arf-p53 pathway.126,131\xE2\x80\x93138Human cyclin D1 is the product of a gene (CCND1) located on chromosome 11q13. Overexpression of cyclin D1 has been observed in many human tumors and is likely to promote cell proliferation and differentiation by shortening the G1/S transition.129,130,139 Amplification of the cyclin D1 gene has been detected in about 15% of breast cancers, while overexpression of cyclin D1 at mRNA and protein levels is seen in up to 50% of primary breast cancers, mostly ER-positive and well-differentiated tumors.129\xE2\x80\x93131 A representative picture of cyclin D1 overexpression in human breast cancer is shown in Figure 2b.Apparently the frequency of cyclin D1 gene amplification (\xE2\x88\xBC15%) is lower than the incidence of overexpression (\xE2\x88\xBC50%). Recently, Barbash et al140 demonstrated that attenuation of cyclin D1 SCFFbx4 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity occurs frequently in human cancer and may represent a common mechanism of overexpression and deregulation of cyclin D1. Significantly, inactivation of the Fbx4 ligase is the result of mutations in N-terminal regulatory regions of Fbx4 that disrupt ligase dimerization, thereby revealing the biological significance of SCF ligase oligomerization. They established Fbx4 as a tumor suppressor in human cancer, the function of which is abrogated by a unique category of mutations that target E3 ligase activity.140The relationship between overexpression of cycli
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: rophylacticsOral contraceptivesContraindications for use of oral contraceptives (OC) by BRCA1 carriers aged below 25 are well documented. It was shown that OC used for 5 years by young women increase breast cancer risk by about 35% [43]. Since in about 50% of BRCA1 carriers family history is negative it seems to be necessary to perform the BRCA1 test in every young woman who wishes to use OC. OC used by BRCA1 carriers after the age of 30 seems not to influence breast cancer risk [43-45] but shows a 50% reduction of ovarian cancer risk [34], so use of OC after the age of 30 appears to be justified. As yet, there are no verified data concerning the effects of OC in families not related to BRCA1 mutation. However, there are studies indicating several-fold increased breast cancer risk in OC users from families with breast cancer aggregation [46]; thus it seams reasonable to avoid OC in families with HBC-ss and/or HBOC.Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)Prophylactic oopherectomy at the age of 35-40 is the gold standard for BRCA1/2 carriers and corresponds with risk reduction for both breast and ovarian cancer. It was shown that carriers after oopherectomy, who use oestrogen HRT, show a similar protective effect as patients who do not use HRT [47,48]. The influence of HRT in carriers without prophylactic oopherectomy is not well documented. Three-fold increased risk of breast cancer in HRT users with positive breast cancer family history was reported [49]. Therefore, the decision about HRT use should be made with particular caution.Breast feedingLong-term breast feeding is indicated in all females from families with HBC-ss, HBOC and HOC. It was shown in BRCA1 carriers that breast feeding over 18 months, counting together all pregnancies, reduces breast cancer risk - from 50-80% to 25-40% [50,51].Early deliveryWomen from the general population who delivered the first child before the age of 20 are at 50% lower breast cancer risk than nulliparous women. This observation was not confirmed in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation [52]. However, taking into consideration the fact that mutation carriers should elect prophylactic oopherectomy at age 35-40, they should not delay maternity significantly.ChemopreventionTamoxifenLiterature data clearly indicate that tamoxifen reduces by about 50% the risk of ER+ breast cancers. This effect was observed in healthy women as well as in women treated for breast cancer, where tamoxifen reduced the risk of contralateral breast cancer. A protective effect of tamoxifen was also observed in BRCA1 carriers in spite of the fact that most cancers in these patients are ER-. Such an effect of tamoxifen was observed in pre- and postmenopausal women [53,54]. According to present data it is justified to propose 5 year chemoprevention with tamoxifen to patients from families with HBC-ss, HBOC and BRCA1 mutation carriers as well after exclusion of all contraindications, especially related to clotting problems and endometrial hypertrophy.SeleniumStudies performed in our centre showed increased mutagen sensitivity in BRCA1 carriers as measured with the bleomycin test. This sensitivity may be normalized with some selenium supplements [55]. Chemoprevention with selenium has been observed to reduce cancer risk in both humans and animals. This question should be answered in BRCA1 carriers.AdnexectomyBoth retrospective and prospective observations of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations indicate that prophylactic adnexectomy decreases the risk of ovarian/peritoneal cancer to about 5% and breast cancer to 30-40%. Application of adnexectomy together with tamoxifen reduces breast cancer risk to about 10% in BRCA1 carriers [14]. Therefore, in our centre adnexectomy is recommended to all BRCA1/2 carriers aged over 35. This surgery is proposed to women from families with HBC-ss, HBOC and HOC but without detected BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation only if other pathologies of the female genital tract were recorded during control examinations. About 85% of our patients accept this type of prophylaxis [56].MastectomyThe main target of prophylactic mastectomy is reduction of breast cancer risk by removal of tissue at risk. Single cases of breast cancer can develop from the chest wall or from the axillary cave after prophylactic mastectomy. It was noted, however, that only 1% of patients from this group develop breast cancer after prophylactic surgery [57]. It seams reasonable to offer this type of surgery to highly motivated patients with definitively diagnosed high cancer risk, especially where tumoural and mammographically dense breast glands are observed which make early diagnosis extremely difficult. At present, mastectomies with immediate reconstruction are performed most frequently. This procedure ensures a good cosmetic effect [58].SurveillanceSurveillance in patients with HBC-ss, HBOC, HOC, as well as in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers is shown in Table 4. This scheme is individualized for particular patients with respect to age when particular examinations should begin. In some families where breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 25 or ovarian cancer before the age of 35 surveillance should begin 5 years earlier than the age of diagnosis of cancer in this family. In some cases, in addition to breast and ovary investigations patients receive colonoscopy, gastroscopy or evaluation of PSA level and prostate ultrasound if in family members symptoms from the colon, gastric or urinal tract are observed. However, it should be noted that some control examinations have limited value in detection of early cancers in BRCA1 carriers. Ovarian cancer in clinical stage I is detected in only 10% of women with a BRCA1 mutation. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis of early breast cancers is introducing significant progress [28,59]. This examination allows detection of 77% of breast cancers with diameter smaller than 1 cm and in combination with ultrasound its sensitivity in detection of early breast cancers rises to over 90% in BRCA1 carriers [59].Table 4Scheme of control examinations in families with high breast/ovarian cancer syndromesOrganExaminationAge of beginning(years)FrequencyBreastself examination20every monthmedical palpation20-25every 6 monthsUSG25every 6 months (6 months after mammography)MRI25every 12 monthsmammography35every 12 monthsFemale genital tracttransvaginal ultrasound30-35every 12 monthsCA 12530-35every 12 months (6 months after USG)TreatmentExisting data indicate that different rules should be applied or at least considered as an option in treatment of BRCA1 carriers. They include:\xE2\x80\xA2 radical mastectomy instead of lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy, because the risk of local recurrence in the above procedures is 1% and 8%, respectively (Narod SA, data not published);\xE2\x80\xA2 tamoxifen use in spite of ER- breast cancer, because of 50% risk reduction of contralateral breast cancer [53,60];\xE2\x80\xA2 adnexectomy not only because of prophylaxis but also because it was noted that 10-year survival is twice as high in patients after this type of treatment (Narod SA, data not published);\xE2\x80\xA2 breast cancer chemotherapy based on schemes without taxanes [61]; treatment results based on schemes with cis-platinum are very promising.Syndromes associated with genetic changes of moderately increased riskThe essential problem of clinical genetics is increased hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer in families with negative history of these cancers. Because of the small number of family members in present families, inheritance by the male line and not full penetrance, the influence of high risk genes like BRCA1/2 should be taken into consideration also in such families (about 50% of BRCA1 mutation carriers with breast cancer come from unaffected families [20]). However, a clear majority of cancers in such families are associated with other factors. The influence of multiple environmental factors on cancer risk has already been documented in the past. Recently, it has been shown that over 90% of patients with breast cancer carry constitutional genetic changes predisposing to development of this cancer [62]. In most cases, they are changes of moderately increased risk. In that context we can suppose that unfavourable environmental factors could lead to cancer development only in patients with a particular genetic background. To date the significance of several genetic changes has been documented in the Polish population, which is the cause for different options of clinical management for these patients. It was found that constitutional changes in the genes CHEK2 (1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, del5395, I157T), NBS1 (657del5), NOD2 (3020insC), CDKN2A (A148T), BRCA2 (5972C/T polymorphism) and CYP1B1 (homozygous GTC) are associated with increased breast cancer risk in the Polish population [63,64]. Carrier status of protein truncated mutation in the CHEK2 gene (1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, del5395) is associated with about 2.2-fold increased breast cancer risk. This risk concerns both young and older patients [63,64]. Therefore, the control breast examination in this group of patients starts from 25 years of age according to the scheme shown in Table 5. Carriers of mutation CHEK2 I157T have increased cancer risk to a smaller degree (1.4-fold higher than that in the general population).Table 5Options of control examinations for carriers of moderate cancer risk gene mutationsOrganExaminationAge of beginning(years)FrequencyCHEK2 (1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, del5395), NBS1 (657del5), NOD2 (3020insC), CDKN2A (A148T)self examination20every monthmedical palpation20-25every 6 monthsUSG25every 12 months(6 months after mammography)BRCA2 (5972C/T), CYP1B1 (homozygote GTC)mammography35every 12 monthsCHEK2 (I157T)self examination20every monthmedical palpation40every 6 monthsUSG40every 12 months(6 months after mammography)MRI40every 12 monthsmammography40every 12 monthsOccurrence of breast cancer at young age is not

BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are also found in complexes with Rad51, a protein important for the cellular response to DNA damage.192,194 In addition, BRCA1 is phosphorylated by the ATM/ATR kinases, in response to DNA damage (Fig. 1).Thus, both BRCA proteins are now emerging as central gatekeepers of genomic stability.190,195 In studies of mice bearing a conditional knockout of the Brca1 gene, it has been implicated in mammary ductal morphogenesis and checkpoint control in the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Perhaps the most interesting among BRCA1 protein-protein interactions in mammary epithelial cells is the one with the ER\xCE\xB1.196 This apparently key anti-estrogenic effect may place the BRCA proteins on center stage for control of the sex steroid-regulated pathways, long suspected to induce breast cancer.Breast cancers of BRCA1/2 carriers more often have a high nuclear grade, poorly differentiated morphology, negativity to ER/PR/HER2, positivity to cytokeratins, overexpression of cyclin E, low expression of p27KIP1, and p53 mutations.194 BRCA1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer within an Ashkenazi Jewish population in several studies.197 Chappuis et al198 reported that BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were associated with shorter survival (58% vs. 82%, P = 0.003) in a Canadian Ashkenazi Jewish population. In another Canadian Ashkenazi Jewish population, Foulkes et al199 showed that the survival rate was 50% in those with BRCA1 mutations and 90% in their controls. Later, Robson et al200 studied 496 archived tissue blocks (43 cases of BRCA1 mutations, 14 cases of BRCA2 mutations, and 440 control patients); the overall 10-year survival rate was 62% in the BRCA1 mutation group and 86% in the control (P < 0.0001), but there was no difference in the BRCA2 mutation group versus controls.200A recent study of BRCA1/2 mutations in young breast cancer patients (age 36 or less)201 showed that carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations had a \xE2\x88\xBC25% lower 3-year survival rate and were less likely to express ER, PR, and HER2, the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Ctriple-negative\xE2\x80\x9D form of the disease associated with poor prognosis. Another study showed that patients who were mutant BRCA1/2 carriers had increased 25-year contralateral breast cancer recurrence compared with patients without those mutations; this recurrence was 1.6-fold higher in patients with BRCA1 mutations compared to BRCA2 mutations.202 Additionally, patients diagnosed prior to age 40 had a significantly better chance of survival compared to those diagnosed later in life.202 However, other studies have failed to demonstrate the prognostic values of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer, possibly because 1) the sample sizes of those with BRCA1/2 mutations was too small, 2) studies were biased by including only surviving patients, 3) there was no adjustment for therapy or other factors.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is composed of a family of five isoforms (VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD, and PLGF) which act as ligands for tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGF-Rs).203 Upon binding of VEGF to its receptors (primarily VEGFR2), intracellular signaling pathways, including MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt, are activated that mediate angiogenic switches (Fig. 1). This activation of angiogenesis in both normal and cancerous tissue is dependent on increased endothelial cell proliferation and invasion, increased vessel permeability, and recruitment of other support cells that make up the vessel architecture, such as pericytes.VEGF and angiogenesis are important to tumor growth and metastasis across a range of solid tumor types.204\xE2\x80\x93206 VEGF has been implicated as a key mediator of angiogenesis in breast cancer.206,207 In one study, Yoshiji et al207 found that VEGF expression was markedly upregulated compared with surrounding normal tissue in each of the 18 human breast tissue samples evaluated. In a separate study assessing the role of VEGF in breast cancer, Brown et al208 observed VEGF to be expressed at high levels in ductal carcinoma (comedo-type, invasive, and metastatic), but not in infiltrating lobular carcinoma. In a series of elegant experiments, Relf and colleagues209 isolated selected angiogenic factors from 64 primary breast tumors and investigated their relationship to tumor growth and progression. These factors included VEGF, transforming growth factor-\xCE\xB21 (TGF-\xCE\xB21), pleiotrophin, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor. Overall, VEGF was one of the most important mediators of tumor angiogenesis in human breast cancer tissue, and elevated VEGF levels correlated with poor survival.Toi and colleagues210 demonstrated that VEGF expression is associated with microvessel density in breast tumor biopsies. Their postoperative tissue analysis of 328 primary breast cancer patients showed a positive correlation between the rate of VEGF expression and microvessel density. While many pro-angiogenic factors have been identified in breast cancer, VEGF appears to be the only factor expressed throughout the entire life cycle of a breast tumor. Hence all the above reports have confirmed that VEGF is associated with increased microvessel density in breast cancer.The most important factor that determines survival of breast cancer patients is dissemination of cancer cells from primary site into distant organs and establishment of metastatic colonies. Comparison of gene signatures from primary tumor, regional, and distant metastasis indicates that VEGF is only overexpressed in distant metastasis and is associated with poor survival. More importantly and clinically significant, Shivakumar et al211 showed that increased serum VEGF levels were detectable in patients with metastatic compared to benign lesions and were positively correlated with tumor grade. In a retrospective study of 679 patients, Linderholm et al212 showed significantly higher levels of intra-tumoral VEGF in patients with triple-negative breast cancers compared to other types of breast cancers.Jacobs and colleagues showed that an increased risk of invasive breast cancer was correlated with 2 VEGF gene polymorphisms, VEGF-2578C and VEGF-1154G,213 both hypothesized to increase expression of VEGF. Intense angiogenic activity has been observed in inflammatory breast cancer. In an attempt to characterize the angiogenic phenotype of this disease, van der Auwera et al214 measured mRNA expression of tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis factors in patients with both inflammatory (n = 16) and noninflammatory (n = 20) breast cancer. Although both forms of the disease exhibited high levels of angiogenic activity, inflammatory breast cancer showed significantly higher mRNA expression of angiogenic and lymphangiogenic genes, including those encoding for VEGF-C and VEGF-D. These observations may help clarify why inflammatory breast cancer has a high metastatic potential via hematogenous and lymphatic routes.Potential use of molecular prognostic markers for early detection, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of breast cancerThe use of classical markers such as Ki67, ER, PR, and HER2 for the prediction of patients\xE2\x80\x99 survival and treatment response of breast cancer has been well established, and thus, they will be continued to be used as useful laboratory tests. Although numerous genetic and phenotypic alterations have been reported in breast cancer, only a handful have been fully identified and brought to clinical studies. Among molecules regulating the p53 and RB tumor suppressor pathways, mutation of p53, overexpression of cyclin D1b, LMW cyclin E are apparently associated with poor clinical outcome of patients. Experiments using transgenic/knockout mice for these molecules have provided unique perspectives of these molecules to the biology of breast cancer. Although p53 mutations have been extensively studied in human breast cancer, only a few studies have been conducted on the prognostic values of the upstream regulators for p53, such as overexpression of Hdm2, TBX2/3, Pokemon, or inactivation of p14ARF, hDMP1. It is expected that p53 will remain intact when upstream p53 regulators are altered in tumor cells. Examination of human breast cancer samples for the alterations of these molecules and determination of their prognostic values will be useful for future diagnosis, development of novel therapies, and prevention of breast cancer.\",\"id\":\"1de22018-842e-4a9e-bb34-7e2efee52e46\",\"_version_\":1534952611034169344}]}}\n"

This cancer is difficult to diagnose using mammography; therefore in this group of patients magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended from 40 years of age. Mutation 657del5 in the NBS1 gene is associated with about 3.5-fold increased risk of breast cancer and this increase is the strongest for patients below 40 years old [66] and with positive cancer family history [67]. Mutation 3020insC in the NOD2 gene is associated with breast cancer at young age (OR = 1.9). Characteristic for this mutation is ductal breast cancer with a DCIS component [68]. This kind of cancer is more often accompanied by multiple calcifications; therefore mammography can be useful in prophylaxis of patients with mutations in the NOD2 gene. Polymorphism 5972C/T in the BRCA2 gene is also associated with increased risk of breast cancer before 40 years of age (OR = 1.4). The risk of cancer development is higher in homozygotes (OR = 4.8). This effect is observed at both young and older age [69]. Increased risk is also observed in carriers of CDKN2A A148T (OR = 1.5) and CYP1B1 (homozygote GTC) (OR = 1.5). In these cases an increased cancer risk at young age is observed. Medical care for patients with genetic changes NBS1 (657del5), NOD2 (3020insC), BRCA2 (5972C/T), CDKN2A (A148T), and CYP1B1 (homozygote GTC) begins at 25 years. Studies on the group of patients with a family history of ovarian cancer allowed characteristic clinical features of ovarian cancers without constitutional mutations in genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 to be distinguished. Cancers in this group, unlike cases arising on the basis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation, are more often diagnosed in postmenopausal (51-60 years) women and also show lower morphological grading and clinical staging. Analysis of the kind and location of cancers among relatives of examined women showed the increased frequency of ovarian cystadenoma (cystadenoma ovarii) [70]. Cystadenomas of the ovary are benign tumours which are able to, in some cases, undergo malignant transformation into borderline malignancy tumours, and sometimes even into cancer (cystadenocarcinoma) [71,72]. For development of this kind of tumours the following constitutional changes can predispose: NOD2 3020insC, CHEK2 I157T, CYP1B1 355T/T and DHCR7 W151X. In the group of \\\"increased risk\\\" there are mainly women at reproductive age (\xE2\x89\xA550 years), who being carriers of at least one of the above-mentioned molecular changes have over twofold increased risk of the development of ovarian borderline malignancy tumours (OR 2.26, P = 0.0005). Therefore for these women it should be considered to extend the screening options with an additional control examination of transvaginal USG (once a year) from 20-25 years. Early tumour detection and its surgical resection can prevent the development of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in the case of the 355T/T variant CYP1B1 gene carriers the screening options are extended with an additional control examination for MRI of the breast (once a year) for women aged 30-35 years, on account of almost 3-fold increased risk of the development of cancer of this organ (OR 2.75, P = 0.03) [73,74]. The preventive screening is also recommended to first and second degree female relatives of patients with ovarian cystadenoma including:\xE2\x80\xA2 control examination by using transvaginal USG (once a year), if in the patient ovarian borderline malignancy tumour and CHEK2 I157T were detected;\xE2\x80\xA2 control breast examination using MRI (once a year) in the case of female relatives of patients with the 355T/T variant of the CYP1B1 gene and with benign ovarian tumour.Studies on genetic predisposition to breast cancer or ovarian cystadenoma indicate the existence of multigenetic relations causing high risk of cancer development. It will probably require many years of analysis to discover them.SummaryAround 14 000 women develop breast or ovarian cancer in Poland every year. Advances in clinical genetics of cancers allow a significant number of these cancers to be prevented. Additionally, patients of known genetic background may be more effectively diagnosed and treated due to the application of special, nonstandard systems of control examinations and treatment.Figure 2Family with fulfilled clinical-pedigree criteria \\\"suspected HBC-ss\\\".

Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, and, to a lesser extent, CHEK2, TP53 and ATM, account for \xE2\x88\xBC25% of familial breast tumours (2). The remaining 75% of familial breast cancers (BRCAx tumours) and the majority of sporadic tumours are not attributable to known mutations in any of these genes. In bilateral cases of breast cancer (a second primary tumour in the contra-lateral breast), it is believed that the underlying \xE2\x80\x98mutation\xE2\x80\x99 is not limited to the epithelial cells of one breast, but rather is systemic (3). The importance of epigenetic changes in cancer development is now well established; however, the role of epigenetic changes as a mechanism for increased cancer risk is yet to be fully explored. Therefore, we hypothesized that some of the systemic epigenetic changes are either inherited or acquired in the early developmental stages and therefore should be detectable in the tissues other than breast, such as peripheral blood DNA (4,5). Since carcinogenesis induces numerous genetic and epigenetic changes, the study of tumour cells alone cannot distinguish whether epigenetic inactivation of tumour suppressor genes is a cause or a consequence of the neoplastic process in breast cancer (6). Identification of epimutations in the tissues and cells that are not affected by the disease process would favour causal association. Therefore, we aimed to identify epigenetic misregulation of candidate genes in the normal peripheral blood cells of cancer patients compared with controls.Epigenetics is the investigation of \xE2\x80\x98any information that is carried by the genome that is not coded by DNA\xE2\x80\x99 and includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin structure and non-coding RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression and various other genomic functions (7). DNA methylation studies in cancer revealed two main types of changes: hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands and hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences (8). DNA methylation is heritable through mitosis and is copied to the new strand by DNA methylatransferase 1 during DNA replication. Meiotic heritability of DNA methylation states, particularly transposon-associated methylation, has been shown in mice and in plants; however, it is not yet clear whether DNA methylation is heritable through meiosis in humans (9,10). Recent evidence suggests that epimutations are likely to arise somatically (11). Apart from trans-generational inheritance of epigenetic states, single-generation germline epigenetic effects are also possible. During germ cell development, the epigenome is reprogrammed with two waves of demethylation and re-establishment of DNA methylation marks allowing the possibility of errors that could persist in the germline (12). We have previously shown that the male germline exhibits locus-, cell- and age-dependent DNA methylation differences and that DNA methylation variation is significant across unrelated individuals, at a level that, by far, exceeds DNA sequence variation (13). This has allowed us to hypothesize that epigenetic variation in normal somatic cells, which need not be transgenerational, could be a predisposing factor for cancer.DNA methylation alterations have been studied extensively in breast tumour tissues most recently with genome wide analyses revealing hypermethylated as well as hypomethylated loci compared with matched adjacent tissues (14). Approximately 100 candidate genes have been reported throughout the literature as promoters hypermethylated at varying frequencies in breast cancers (Pubmeth http://matrix.ugent.be/pubmeth/search.html). For our study, we have selected genes that have either previously been identified as breast cancer susceptibility genes with known mutations in familial cases (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, TP53) or genes that are frequently hypermethylated in sporadic breast cancers (ESR1, SFN, CDKN2A, GSTP1, CDH1, CDH13, HIC1, PGR, SFRP1, MLH1, RARB and HSD17B4). We have used a two-stage design to firstly identify methylation variable positions (MVPs) in peripheral blood DNA and then secondly to test selected sites for an association with breast cancer in a larger sample set.RESULTSMicroarray analysisWe performed differential DNA methylation analysis using a methylation-sensitive enzyme-based approach to compare the methylation status of peripheral blood DNA of 14 bilateral breast cancer cases with 14 matched controls. We have designed a custom-tiled microarray covering a total of 4 Mb to completely cover 17 breast cancer susceptibility genes (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A) and an additional 34 genes also captured in the

Therefore, the small effect (increase in methylation at ATM mvp2b) in patients compared with controls could be due to a larger effect in a small subpopulation of cells within the heterogeneous peripheral blood cell population. We have addressed this question by isolation of B cells, T cells and monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two healthy controls and investigating the methylation status of this locus. We show that the methylation of ATMmvp2b does not show cell-specific methylation differences between these three blood cell fractions, and all fractions have similar methylation levels to the whole PBMCs (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5).In order to investigate the relationship between methylation at ATM mvp2b and expression of ATM, we screened a large panel of cancer cell lines and observed a similar methylation range as seen in peripheral blood (77\xE2\x80\x9399%); however, the distribution of methylation percentages is significantly higher in the cancer cell lines than in the peripheral blood DNA of the patients and controls (P < 1e\xE2\x80\x9314, Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Fig.\xC2\xA04A). We performed quantitative RT\xE2\x80\x93PCR for ATM expression in five breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and BT549) and analysed pre-existing gene expression data for 18 mesenchymal tumour cell lines (16) (Fig.\xC2\xA04B and C). In both cases, we observed a correlation between the methylation of the intragenic repetitive element and expression of ATM (Spearmans rho \xE2\x88\x920.9 and \xE2\x88\x920.33, respectively).Figure\xC2\xA04.Correlation between methylation of ATM mvp2b and expression of ATM in cancer cell lines. (A) Methylation analysis in 62 cancer cell lines reveals a similar range of methylation as in PBMCs of breast cancer patients (77\xE2\x80\x9399%); however, the distribution is skewed towards increased methylation in the cancer cell lines (green). Methylation distributions of breast cancer patients (red) and controls (black) are shown for comparison. (B) ATM expression was determined by qRT\xE2\x80\x93PCR in the five breast cancer cell lines and by gene expression microarray data (C) for a panel of sarcoma cell lines. Error bars represent SEM from triplicate qRT\xE2\x80\x93PCR experiments. Correlation between methylation and expression is shown using Spearmans rank correlation coefficient.DISCUSSIONThis project is the first comprehensive DNA methylation study using high-density tiling arrays to look for methylation variation in white blood cells of bilateral breast cancer patients compared with controls. It is well established that identification of high-risk patients guiding the use of preventative treatment such as intensive surveillance (e.g. mammography), chemoprevention (e.g. tamoxifen) or prophylactic surgery (e.g. radical mastectomy) can significantly reduce the burden of breast cancer (17). Therefore, all additional tools with which we can predict a patient\xE2\x80\x99s risk of cancer, such as DNA methylation markers, would improve our ability to identify those at high risk. The difficulty in finding genetic markers of common breast cancer risk has been recently exemplified by a number of extraordinarily large case\xE2\x80\x93control studies that have identified only minor increases in breast cancer risk (18,19). The overall goal of this current study was to screen candidate genes for epigenetic differences in peripheral blood DNA to identify markers of common breast cancer risk. We believe that DNA methylation markers could be more informative, as they are more stable than other candidate biomarkers such as RNA or protein-based markers, and can act as a surrogate for environmental exposures (20). The extent to which epigenetic markers can be used for risk assessment is yet to be fully explored.\xE2\x80\x98Gene body methylation\xE2\x80\x99 is a recent term describing the DNA methylation that occurs throughout the gene from the TSS, through exons and introns, to the 3\xE2\x80\xB2 untranslated region (21\xE2\x80\x9323). In Arabidopsis, the level of gene-body methylation has been linked to the level of gene transcription such that gene-body methylation was absent in genes that were not transcribed, was low in genes that were transcribed at low levels, higher levels of methylation in the highest transcribed genes but even higher methylation levels in genes that had intermediate levels of transcription (22). Gene-body methylation is also more associated with genes on the active X chromosome rather than on the inactive X-chromosome (21). The association with the transcription of individual genes and gene-body methylation has not yet been investigated in cancer. We have recently suggested that gene-body methylation in the human genome may be associated with intragenic repetitive elements and that altered methylation in the gene-body may be a mechanism of modulating the level of transcription (24). In the present study, we show for the first time that the methylation of one intragenic repetitive element inversely correlates with the expression of the gene which supports this hypothesis. Although there are numerous examples in the literature showing that active genes have more gene-body methylation levels than inactive genes, all of these studies compare the gene body methylation levels of one gene with another and compare the expression levels (22). These studies make a distinction between \xE2\x80\x98On\xE2\x80\x99 expression and gene-body methylation compared with \xE2\x80\x98Off\xE2\x80\x99 expression and no gene-body methylation. We suggest from our data that the level of gene-body methylation may be modulating or fine-tuning the level of expression of the active genes. To date, there has been no report looking at the subtle differences in gene-body methylation across samples and associating that with the expression of the same gene in those samples. Therefore, our study is the first report of an association between different levels of gene-body methylation and expression of the same gene.How gene-body methylation may alter the gene expression, or alternatively how expression level may affect the methylation level, is still not clear. The mvp within ATM that we have identified could be a reporter of a more extended regulatory epigenetic profile at ATM, similar to a tag SNP for a region of linkage disequilibrium in DNA sequence variation. Alternatively, this region could be involved in the regulation of unannotated non-coding transcript(s) or antisense transcripts that regulate the sense gene (22). Recent reports have shown a high level of antisense transcription throughout the genome which could be involved in gene regulation, which suggests new levels of understanding of the process of transcriptional regulation (25,26).Our study of the breast cancer susceptibility genes has provided evidence that the regions of inter-individual methylation variability are located within repetitive elements, particularly SINEs (Alu sequences), and that the variability is highest at \xE2\x88\xBC1 kb downstream of the TSSs and increases periodically along the gene. We interpret this increased variability as the point in the genome where the methylation along the chromatin is changing from unmethylated at the promoters to fully methylated in the gene-body. We have identified one repetitive element, ATM mvp2b, which is significantly more methylated in the peripheral blood DNA of women affected with bilateral breast cancer compared with matched control individuals. On its own, this is not sufficient to be considered a potential diagnostic test, as there is considerable overlap between cases and controls and the receiver operating curve area under the curve of 0.59 supports this lack of specificity as a diagnostic. However, this may improve in combination with similar markers from the other genes that we have identified, if such markers provide an additive effect. Interestingly, not all genes showed signs of inter-individual methylation variability. For some of the genes, this could be explained by the short length (e.g. SFN, GSTP1 and HIC1); however, this is not the case for other longer genes which could represent genes with conserved methylation patterns (e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53) compared with other long genes that show high levels of methylation variability (e.g. CDH13).The ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) mutated (ATM) gene is considered a breast cancer susceptibility gene, as female heterozygotes from A-T families have an increased risk of breast cancer and a number of breast cancer families have been identified with germline ATM mutations (27,28). Although one small study by Vo et al. identified increased ATM promoter methylation associated with decreased expression in locally advanced sporadic breast cancers, numerous other reports suggest no evidence of promoter methylation of this gene in breast cancers (29\xE2\x80\x9332). One finding that is consistent is that ATM expression is often reduced in breast tumours (31\xE2\x80\x9334). This could be explained by genetic haploinsufficiency (35); however, our data in peripheral blood DNA and cancer cell lines suggest a novel mechanism of decreased expression mediated by aberrant gene-body methylation, which warrants further investigation in tumour ti

Malignant progression of breast cancer involves the conversion of \xE2\x80\x9Cbenign proliferative lesions\xE2\x80\x9D and carcinomas in situ to early (stages I and II) disease, to locally advanced (stage III) disease, and then to metastasis to bone, brain, lungs, and other sites (stage IV).Fundamental to malignant progression are the heterotypic processes regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hypoxia, desmoplasia, and angiogenesis5,6 The development of cancer involves dysregulation of proliferative-signaling and growth-inhibitory factors, activation of oncogenes, and loss of tumor suppressor genes, all of which result in suppression of apoptosis and senescence.6 The increasing understanding of the pathophysiological background of breast cancer is associated with new molecular techniques, improved risk assessment, targeted therapy, and individualized treatment.1,3,7 Gene expression profiling may provide predictive and prognostic gene signatures which could help characterize tumors and enable more tailored therapies.8,9Interest in novel prognostic markers is based on the fact that a significant number of patients with early-stage breast cancer harbor microscopic metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Many molecular markers that have been studied have both prognostic and predictive values. Prognostic markers are indicators of aggressiveness, invasiveness, extent of spread of tumors, and thus, correlate with survival independent of systemic therapy and can be used to select patients at risk. On the other hand, predictive markers are reports which allow clinicians to expect therapeutic outcomes and decide future treatment plans. This review summarizes mainly the prognostic values of classical (Ki67, ER, PR, HER2) and novel molecular factors (p53, p14ARF, cyclin D1, cyclin E, TBX2/3, BRCA1/2, and VEGF) for breast cancer. These novel molecular markers have been chosen from the viewpoint of involvement in the regulation of the p53 and RB tumor suppressor pathways, DNA damage response, and angiogenesis/metastasis, which play critical roles in human breast cancer development.Ki67Proliferative markers have been broadly evaluated as prognostic factor for early stage breast cancer patients. Ki67, a nuclear non-histone protein, was identified by Gerdes et al as after immunization of mice with the Hodgkin\xE2\x80\x99s lymphoma.10\xE2\x80\x9313 Ki67 is expressed only in cells in the proliferative phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M phases). Ki67 is vital for cell proliferation, since downregulation of Ki67 using antisense nucleotides prevents cell proliferation.10 Ki67 is tightly controlled and regulated, implying a fundamental role in cell proliferation. However, it has been very difficult to determine its function because of its lack of obvious homology with known proteins. Bridger et al suggested a role of Ki67 in organizing DNA, based on its localization to extranucleolar sites during early G1; these sites contain centromeric and satellite DNA.14 Ki67 is also known to bind to DNA. Mac-Callum and Hall suggested a structural role for Ki67 within the nucleolus, based on its ability to interact with other proteins and bind with RNA and DNA.14,15 They also suggested that Ki67 is an essential factor in the synthesis of ribosomes during cell division.15 Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the roles of Ki67 in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.Ki67 expression is usually estimated as the percentage of tumor cells positively stained by the antibody, with nuclear staining being the most common criterion of proliferative index. Numerous studies have shown that Ki67 is of prognostic value in many types of malignant tumors. In breast cancer, most studies show a strong, statistically significant correlation with clinical outcomes, both on univariate and multivariate analyses. A strong correlation has been noted between the percentage of cells positive for Ki67 and the nuclear grade, age, and mitotic rate.16,17 Multiple studies have indicated that breast cancer overexpress Ki67 in more than 20\xE2\x80\x9350% of the cells are at high risk of developing recurrent disease, showing a statistically significant correlation with clinical outcome, such as disease-free survival or overall survival.18\xE2\x80\x9330The predictive value of Ki67 on the survival of breast cancer patients has also been studied. To determine the clinical significance of the level of tumor cell proliferation during endocrine therapy for breast cancer, Dowsett et al31 measured the expression of Ki67 in tumor biopsy samples taken before and after 2 weeks of pre-surgical treatment with anastrozole or tamoxifen alone, or the combination, in 158 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In a multivariable analysis, they found that higher Ki67 expression after 2 weeks of endocrine therapy was associated with lower recurrence-free survival (P = 0.004) whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not.31 To compare the prognostic significance of Ki67 expression in breast cancer before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the expression of Ki67 was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in pre-therapy core-needle biopsy and post-therapy surgical excision specimens.32 In a matched cohort of 103 patients, post-therapy Ki67 was the only significant independent prognostic factor among Ki67, ER, PR, HER2, clinical stage, histology on multivariate analysis of relapse-free survival. On multivariate analysis for overall survival, both pre- and excision Ki67 expression was significant independent predictors, but the latter showed a stronger prognostic impact. In a cohort of 284 patients with only excision samples, post-therapy Ki67 was a significant independent prognostic factor. They concluded that post-chemotherapy Ki67 is a strong predictor of outcome for patients not achieving a pathological complete response.32,33 In addition, Ki67 correlates with other well-characterized proliferation markers, such as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is a target of E2Fs34 (Fig. 1). Ki67 staining will continued to be used as a useful laboratory test to predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients since it is technically easier and more closely associated with clinical outcomes than DNA ploidy analysis or S phase measurement by flow cytometry.Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors (ER and PR)The ER and PR are dimeric, gene-regulatory proteins. Estrogen and progesterone are well-established endocrine steroid regulators that modulate multiple aspects of mammary gland pathology. These two hormones work together to direct mammary epithelial growth, differentiation, and survival.35 Although both steroids are commonly thought to be of primary importance for tumors arising in the reproductively competent years, between puberty and menopause, local aromatization of adrenal androgens provides additional estrogens in the postmenopausal years. Estrogen and progesterone act through their nuclear receptors to modulate transcription of target genes.35,36 Genes encoding the receptors for each class of steroids are members of a single large superfamily of transcription-modulating factors. ERs may exist either in homodimeric or heterodimeric species, composed of \xCE\xB1 and \xCE\xB2 receptors acting as hormone-dependent transcriptio
2016-05-22T09:35:40.331491+00:00 app[web.1]: nal regulators. 37 The ER pathway plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of human breast cancer. Although it is known that ER\xCE\xB1 is of key importance in the mammary ductal elongation of puberty, PR and ER\xCE\xB2 appear to be more involved with lactational differentiation of the lobules.38,39 From knockout studies in mice, it is apparent that PR plays important role in ductal and lobuloalveolar development of normal mammary gland.40Overexpression of ER\xCE\xB1 is a well-established prognostic factor in breast cancer patients. Generally, ER\xCE\xB1-positive breast cancers are associated with slow tumor growth, lower histology grade, DNA diploidy, and thus a better overall prognosis.35 More than 90% of lobular breast carcinomas are ER-positive; while medullary and inflammatory carcinomas are predominantly ER-negative. ER/PR-negative tumors are often associated with aggressive disease, and these tumors frequently show amplification of HER2, c-Myc, and Int2 oncogenes, and mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene.The value of ER\xCE\xB1 status as an independent prognostic variable has been diminished by its association with other established indicators of favorable prognosis. These include older age of the patient, low-grade histology, a favorable nuclear grade, a low S-phase fraction, a normal content of DNA, a low proliferative index, and a low thymidine labeling index.41 In addition, because adjuvant or palliative hormone therapy is a common treatment for patients with ER-positive tumors receives, it is difficult to evaluate the prognostic value of their ER status alone. In some studies, the longer duration of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival rates of patients with ER\xCE\xB1-positive tumors are seen only in the presence of hormone therapy. In addition, the favorable effect of ER\xCE\xB1-positive status as a discriminant often is lost after several years, suggesting that treatment benefit is temporary.42,43 When node-positive patients not receiving adjuvant hormone therapy were studied, the 5-year DFS rate was 20% higher for ERpositive patients compared with that for ER-negative patients. However, the 5-year DFS rate of the most favorable subgroup (i.e. patients with one to three positive nodes and ER-positive tumors) was below 60%.42 Among node-negative patients, small but statistically significant differences in DFS and overall survival rates have been found between ER-positive cases and ER-negative cases after various periods of follow-up. The results of a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in over 3,000 patients showed ER status to be more important for prognosis than tumor size in node-negative cases, but not in node-positive cases.43 In one study, the ER status was less important for predicting duration of DFS or overall survival than the nuclear grade and the number of positive nodes.44 Allred and colleagues showed that tamoxifen decreased the risk of local regional recurrence in patients with ER-positive ductal carcinoma in situ.45The prognostic significance of ER\xCE\xB2 is not well defined.46\xE2\x80\x9348 Honma et al49 studied archival materials from 442 invasive breast cancers treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy and with a long follow-up period (median: 11.1 years) using three antibodies to detect ER\xCE\xB2N, ER\xCE\xB21, and ER\xCE\xB2cx (ER\xCE\xB22). Positive staining for ER\xCE\xB2N or ER\xCE\xB21 was associated with significantly better survival. By contrast, ER\xCE\xB2cx status showed no association with length of survival. ER\xCE\xB21status was significantly associated with longer survival in postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, women. ER\xCE\xB21 positivity was associated with significantly better survival in patients with ER\xCE\xB1(\xE2\x80\x93)PR(\xE2\x80\x93) or ER\xCE\xB1(\xE2\x80\x93)PR(\xE2\x80\x93)HER2(\xE2\x80\x93) (triple-negative) tumors, which are widely believed to have a poor prognosis. Another study also showed that higher expression of ER\xCE\xB2 in ER\xCE\xB1/PR-positive breast cancer was associated with longer overall survival (70% for high ER\xCE\xB2 vs. 30% for low ER\xCE\xB2 at 100 months) compared with the same group of patients expressing much lower levels of ER\xCE\xB2. Differential expression of ER\xCE\xB2 had no prognostic value in patients with ER\xCE\xB1/PR negative breast cancer.50 Further studies will be required to establish the value of ER\xCE\xB2 to predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients.Because the growth of breast cancer is often regulated by the female sex steroids, determinations of the cellular concentrations of ER and PR in the tumor continue to be used as predictors of good prognosis and of potential benefit from anti-hormonal therapy. To improve the value of ER determinations for tumor prognosis, tests for the presence of the estrogen-regulated PR protein are routinely performed. In many breast tumor cell lines\xE2\x80\x94and in normal tissues containing ER, such as the endometrium and brain\xE2\x80\x94PR expression is induced by estrogen.51,52 It is still not known whether ER regulates PR in normal human mammary epithelium in precisely the same subpopulation of ductal and lobular luminal cells, although this assumption is considered to be likely. It is of interest that the ER and PR appear to be strongly up-regulated in ductal carcinoma in situ and in hormone-dependent breast cancer, relative to normal mammary epithelium.PR is a heterodimeric protein with A and B subunits. Overexpression of the PR indicates that the ER pathway is intact, even if the tumor is reported as ER-negative.51,52 When biochemical ligand-binding assays indicate concentrations of 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein or more, the tumors are generally considered ER-positive and PR-positive for clinical purposes. The ER and PR status can be measured using immunohistochemistry. These results correlate closely with biochemical ligand binding assays and clinical response rates to endocrine therapy.53,54 Furthermore, PR promoter methylation is commonly observed in primary breast cancer cases and may be a mechanism by which this protein is downregulated.55 Importantly, higher PR levels are negatively correlated with tumor size and grade. In a recent study, Liu et al showed that expression of PR in ER-positive tumors improved survival of patients receiving estrogen receptor therapy. Hence, PR may be used as prognostic factor in this group of patients.56 In summary, ER will be used as a marker to predict the response to hormonal therapy and PR will be used as a predictor of response to hormonal therapy as well as a prognostic factor in ER+ breast cancers.Estrogen and progesterone are well known as direct modulators of expression of growth factor receptor pathways and downstream, cell-cycle regulatory genes known as nuclear protooncogenes. The nuclear proto-oncoproteins and other cell-cycle regulatory proteins, such as AIB-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D1, represent points of regulatory convergence of steroid and growth factor pathways in cells. Of considerable interest is the observation that the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1 also interacts with the ER\xCE\xB1 to promote its transcriptional activity57,58 (Fig. 1). Parallel observations have also been made with the AIB-1 (amplified in breast cancer 1; SRC-3) protein, regarding both sensitization of ER transactivation and growth factor signal transduction.59 AIB1 is an ER coregulatory protein that together with other co-activators, like transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) and nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR), is implicated in the estrogen signaling pathway and estrogen- regulated tumor progression. An alternatively spliced variant form of AIB-1 is even more potent for these effects.59 It has been reported that ER\xCE\xB1 activation and nuclear localization, as well as coactivator interactions, are regulated through its phosphorylation.5,60Harigopal et al studied the prognostic significance of AIB1, TIF2 and NCoR protein expression in 670 breast cancer specimens by breast tissue microarray, and demonstrated the relationship of coregulatory proteins to ER, PR and HER2/neu.61 High AIB1 expression was associated with poor patient outcome (P = 0.002), while no association was noted for TIF2 (P = 0.376) or NCoR (P = 0.12). When subclassified by nodal or ER status, AIB1 was not prognostic in the node-positive and ER-positive subsets. However, in the ER-negative and node-negative subsets, high AIB1 expression was associated with poor patient outcome (P = 0.02 and P = 0.007 respectively).61 There was significant positive correlation between AIB1 and ER/PR status and with other cofactors (TIF2 and NCoR), but not with HER2/neu status. Thus, high AIB1 expression predicted worse overall survival in this study, suggesting that AIB1 may be involved in breast carcinogenesis.HER2HER2 (also known as c-erbB-2 or neu) is a protooncogene that encodes a 185-kDa tyrosine kinase glycoprotein belonging to the EGFR family.62\xE2\x80\x9365 The extracellular domain in HER2 is 44% homologous to the corresponding region in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the internal domain is 88% homologous to this region in EGFR.66 In addition to EGFR, the type I subfamily includes HER2, HER3, and HER4.62,63 These receptors all possess a large glycosylated extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is overexpressed in \xE2\x88\xBC30 % of breast cancer cases, primarily due to gene amplification. Within these cases, 60% are ductal carcinomas in situ and 20\xE2\x80\x9330% are infiltrating breast carcinomas.60,67,68 A representative picture of HER2 overexpression in human breast cancer is shown in Figure 2a.The HER2 status can be determined in human tumor samples using immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Amplification and/or overexpression of the HER2 oncogene are/is associated with a poor DFS rate in patients with ax
