Tamoxifen remains a first-line adjuvant treatment for premenopausal breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor-α (ERα) positive tumors, and is often prescribed to postmenopausal females with ERα+ tumors. Tamoxifen functions as an antagonist to ERα and blocks its signaling pathway in ERα+ breast cancer cells. The risk of recurrence of breast cancer and the risk of contralateral breast cancer are significantly reduced by tamoxifen treatment. Five years of tamoxifen treatment reduced the risk of relapse after 10 years by 37% in females aged 50–59 years, and by 54% in females aged 60–69 years. Recently, a study showed that for patients with ERα+ breast cancer, continuing tamoxifen to 10 years rather than discontinuing at five years produces a further reduction in recurrence and mortality (1). Following its  in the 1970s, tamoxifen has been prescribed to millions of patients with ERα+ breast cancer, which accounts for ~70% of all breast cancer patients (2). Tamoxifen is now available as a generic drug worldwide, which has made it the single most prescribed drug in the world for the treatment of any cancer (2). In 1998, the USA Food and Drug Administration further approved tamoxifen as a breast cancer prevention drug for high-risk patient groups, increasing the number of females that are prescribed with tamoxifen even further.Although tamoxifen is an extremely effective treatment for breast cancer, this drug also has serious side effects. One of the most significant and detrimental side effects of postmenopausal tamoxifen treatment is its ability to increase a patient’s chance of developing endometrial lesions, including hyperplasia, polyps, carcinomas, and sarcoma (3). The increased risk of endometrial cancer varies between studies, ranging from 1.5 to 6.9-fold (4). The risk of endometrial cancer is not associated with the daily dosage of tamoxifen, but with longer duration and accumulative usage (5). The risk of endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users increases significantly with increasing body weight among postmenopausal females (6).Independent from tamoxifen intake, breast cancer patients have an enhanced risk of endometrial proliferative disorders, including hyperplasia, as indicated by the high prevalence of this pathology detected in breast cancer patients undergoing endometrial assessment prior to the initiation of tamoxifen administration (7,8). In a recent study, the baseline hysteroscopic assessment revealed an incidence of 31.3% of overall endometrial morbidity in asymptomatic postmenopausal ERα+ breast cancer patients (9). For patients who have endometrial conditions such as hyperplasia without atypia prior to tamoxifen treatment, the rate of progression to more advanced stage endometrial lesions is almost 50% after 24 months of tamoxifen administration (10).Initially, endometrial cancers induced by tamoxifen exposure were considered tumors with good prognosis. However, more recent studies have found these endometrial cancers to have a relatively poor prognosis. Endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users often belongs to the less favorable morphological subtypes, and thus may have an increased mortality (1). The three-year endometrial cancer specific survival significantly decreases from 94% for non-users to 76% for tamoxifen users of more than five years (5). In a large case-control study on the risk and prognosis of endometrial cancer following tamoxifen use for breast cancer, endometrial cancers of stage III and IV occurred more frequently in long-term tamoxifen users than non-users. In addition, long-term users experience significantly higher risks of developing malignant mixed mesodermal tumors or sarcomas of the endometrium than those not taking tamoxifen (15.4% vs. 2.9%; P<0.02). Breast cancer survivors whose endometrial carcinoma was of a high risk histological type had a longer median duration of prior tamoxifen use compared with that of those with lower risk histological types (11).As the net benefit of tamoxifen greatly outweighs the risk, the worldwide usage of tamoxifen for breast cancer patients is expected to continue, particularly as a generic drug. Therefore, lowering the risk of endometrial cancer for tamoxifen users is an increasingly important cancer prevention target. Unfortunately, since the adverse effects of endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users were reported in 1997, the current understanding of how exposure to tamoxifen affects endometrial tissue and induces endometrial cancer remains limited, despite several mechanisms being proposed. This review summarizes the current view of the possible mechanisms involved and provides an outlook for the future studies towards the prevention of development of endometrial cancer in tamoxifen users.2. Molecular mechanisms for tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancerUnlike the majority of ERα+ breast cancer cells, tamoxifen induces cellular growth in endometrial cancer cells in vitro. Several signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, c-MYC and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) pathways, were elevated upon tamoxifen exposure (12). Consistent with the effects observed in in vitro cell culture, tamoxifen exposure promotes endometrial cell proliferation in vivo. A single injection of tamoxifen strongly induced an increase in uterine wet weight and proliferation in the endometrium at 16 h post-injection in mice (13). A robust induction of proliferation markers, including pRb, cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 was observed at 8–16 h post-injection; a decrease to basal level occurs by 48 h (14). Clinical data comparing the endometrium of tamoxifen users and non-users also indicated that exposure to tamoxifen promotes endometrial proliferation. The apoptosis/proliferation index, determined by measuring the proliferation marker Ki67 and the apoptosis/anti-apoptosis markers Fas, FasL and Bcl2, is higher in the benign endometrial lesions of tamoxifen users compared with those of non-users (15,16). Recently, the BH3 mimetic drug ABT-737 was observed to partially counteract tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia (17). The combined administration of ABT-737 with tamoxifen to severe combined immunodeficiency mice for 10 days reversed the increase in uterine weight induced by tamoxifen treatment only, possibly via the promotion of apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism of the effects of BH3 mimetics in blocking tamoxifen’s effects requires further investigation.In addition to cell proliferation, tamoxifen has been shown to promote cytoskeletal remodeling and migration in endometrial cancer cells. Tamoxifen exposure induces focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation via extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and Src signaling, and thus promotes migration (18). The effects of tamoxifen on cell migration appear to be ER signaling dependent. In ERα positive Ishikawa cells, inhibition of ERα blocks the migration effects of tamoxifen, whereas in ER negative RL95-2 endometrial cancer cells, migration is mediated through G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) and ERK/FAK pathway (19). Notably, tamoxifen not only promotes invasion of endometrial cancer cells, it more than doubles the invasion of endometrial stromal cells in a three-dimensional coculture model (20). Paracrine factors released from endometrial stromal cells are able to promote epithelial proliferation of endometrial cells (21), emphasizing the importance of stromal cells in endometrial carcinogenesis. These results clearly demonstrate the role of tamoxifen on endometrial stromal cells, and raise the possibility that tamoxifen promotes endometrial cancer partially through its effects in the stroma.3. DNA damage induced by tamoxifenTamoxifen is metabolized to an array of metabolites with estrogenic effects, and also to reactive intermediates that may form protein or DNA adducts to cause DNA damage. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that tamoxifen induces malignancies by its genotoxicity. Tamoxifen is known as a strong liver carcinogen in rats (22–25), and a high frequency of p53 mutations is detected in hepatocarcinomas induced by tamoxifen exposure (26). Intraperitoneal administration of tamoxifen to female mice leads to the formation of hepatic DNA adducts (27). However, analysis of tamoxifen (Tam)-DNA adducts in endometrial tissues from patients treated with tamoxifen has yielded mixed results. Several studies failed to detect Tam-DNA adducts in endometrial tissue (28,29), in contrast with a number of other studies (30,31). In addition, Tam-DNA adduct formation has been detected in glandular and surface epithelia following the incubation of human endometrial explants with tamoxifen (32). While Tam-DNA adduct formation is possible in human tissues, compelling evidence that this drives endometrial cancer is lacking. Furthermore, the risk of developing hepatocellular cancer is minimal in females treated with tamoxifen, and Tam-DNA adduct formation in endometrial tissue occurs at an extremely low level and in only a few females. Consistent with the lack of DNA damage effects on tamoxifen-associated endometrial tissue, a large scale chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization analysis comparing the genomic profile of endometrial tumors from long-term (>2 year) tamoxifen exposed and unexposed breast cancer patients revealed that the genomic aberrations are indistinguishable in the two groups (33). Instead, genomic profiles are correlated with morphological subtypes of the endometrial tumors (33). Therefore, the importance of genotoxity as a major pathway for tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancer is unclear.4. Effects of tamoxifen on driver genes of sporadic endometrial cancerSeveral genes have been shown to be associated with sporadic endometrial cancer. One of the most common genetic alterations is the mutation or loss of heterozygosity in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene, which occurs in 35–50% of type I endometrial carcinoma. Other common DNA alterations include increased microsatellite instability (MSI), due to defects in DNA mismatch repair family genes, and gene mutations in K-ras (34), β-catenin and p53. Mutation of the K-ras protooncogene occurs most frequently in codons 12 and 13 of exon 1, and has been detected in 4.5–23% of endometrial hyperplasia and in 18–26% of endometrial carcinomas (35,36). β-catenin mutations are present in 14–44% of type I endometrial cancers, and mutations in MSI are identified in 20–40% of type I endometrial carcinomas, and frequently coexist with PTEN mutations. Sequencing and analysis of genetic mutations of these genes in tissue samples of tamoxifen-associated and sporadic endometrial cancer patients have been conducted by a number of research groups. In the majority of cases, patients with tamoxifen exposure had similar mutation rates in PTEN, p53, and MSI genes as non-exposed females with endometrial cancer (37–40).The frequency of K-ras mutation in tamoxifen-related endometrial polyps is controversial; the incidence was reported to be high (43–64%) in certain cases compared with the 4.5–23% observed with non-users (41,42). Furthermore, the presence of the K-ras mutation is significantly affected by the duration of tamoxifen treatment (43). Conversely, in other reports, no significant difference was observed between tamoxifen-treated and non-treated patients (37–39). Similarly, higher p53 mutation or overexpression rates were reported in several studies (5,39), but not in others (44). β-catenin mutation rates may be elevated in tamoxifen-treated females (38), however, the results are also inconsistent. The likelihood of tamoxifen increasing endometrial cancer rate by enhancing mutations of driver genes for sporadic endometrial cancer is low. Instead, long-term tamoxifen exposure is likely to promote endometrial carcinogenesis predominantly via non-genomic alterations. It is possible that tamoxifen offers endometrial cells that contain pre-existing mutations a growth advantage via estrogenic and epigenetic alterations. The result of these activities is a significant increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer in long-term tamoxifen users.5. Estrogenic effects of tamoxifenIn breast cancer cells, tamoxifen acts as an ER antagonist by competing with estrodiol for binding, and by inducing conformational changes that block the interaction of ER with co-activator proteins (45). However, as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), tamoxifen behaves as an antagonist and/or agonist of ER, depending on the target tissue, and can modulate the signal transduction pathways of estrogen-responsive genes. In endometrial tissue, tamoxifen is known to exert estrogenic actions.One mechanism that may explain the antagonistic and agonistic effects of tamoxifen in different target tissues is the differential recruitment of co-regulators to the ER target gene promoter. In breast cancer cells, tamoxifen induces the recruitment of co-repressors nuclear receptor co-repressor and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors to ER target promoters (12). However, in the endometrium, tamoxifen recruits the co-activators steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1), amplified in breast cancer-1 (AIB1) and CREB-binding protein (CBP), rather than co-repressors, to ER target gene (12). Inhibition of SRC-1 in Ishikawa cells eliminated tamoxifen-induced gene expression (12). This differential co-regulator recruitment appears to be limited to ER targets that do not contain a classical estrogen response element (ERE) in their promoters, including c-MYC and IGF1 (12). The tissue-dependent mode of action of tamoxifen may be explained by the relative abundance of co-factors in different tissues (46). The expression level of co-regulators such as SRC-1 is low in MCF7 breast cancer cells compared with endometrial Ishikawa cells (12). In addition, SRC-1 activity is regulated by Src kinase, which is highly activated in endometrial cancer cells compared with breast cancer cells (47). However, this mechanism only partially explains the differences observed between breast and endometrial cancer cells, as tamoxifen did not display agonistic effects in all estrogen target genes, indicating the involvement of other molecular mechanisms.As well as affecting the transcriptional activity of ERα, tamoxifen has been shown to regulate expression levels of ERα in the endometrium. Several studies have demonstrated that the expression of ERα in benign endometrium is higher in breast cancer patients who use tamoxifen compared to non-tamoxifen-users (48,15), thereby promoting estrogen-mediated cell growth. Conversely, decreased ERα expression on endometrial cancer has also been reported. Over 60% of long term tamoxifen users are ERα negative in endometrium, whereas only 26.2% of non-users are ERα negative (5). This observation is consistent with the evidence that mice orally dosed with tamoxifen during early development showed a marked decrease in expression of ERα, with no or very weak staining in the endometrium, stroma and myometrium (49). An explanation for this discrepancy may be that, in the cells with downregulated ERα, upregulation of other ER splice variants or isoforms by tamoxifen exposure compensated for the loss of ERα. ER-α36, a variant form of ERα that is localized to the plasma membrane, has been shown to be upregulated in endometrial cancer cells (50). The expression of ER-α36 increases with tamoxifen exposure in endometrial cancer cells (50). In addition, ER-α36 mediates the tamoxifen-induced MAPK and Akt pathways, and is essential for tamoxifen-stimulated endometrial cell growth (50).Other than activating nuclear estrogen receptors to induce downstream genomic signaling, estrogen is also known to activate rapid non-genomic signaling events independently of nuclear ER. GPR30, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, has been proposed to be a new membrane-bound estrogen receptor involved in the rapid non-genomic effects of estrogen. GPR30 activation leads to the release of heparin-bound growth factor (HB-EGF), which in turn triggers the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/MAPK transduction pathway (51). In endometrial cancer, overexpression of GPR30 occurs more frequently in high-grade and advanced stage tumors, and is correlated with poor prognosis (52).Tamoxifen acts as an agonist for GPR30 to stimulate cell proliferation and growth.",

        "body": "We read with interest the article by Wegman and coworkers [1] entitled 'Genotype of metabolic enzymes and the benefit of tamoxifen in postmenopausal breast cancer patients'. The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of a tamoxifen adjuvant clinical trial and reported that a small subset of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen who carried the CYP2D6*4 variant allele did significantly better than patients with the same variants not treated with tamoxifen.We believe that these data are actually not in contrast to data presented by us and others, as the authors suggest. Rather, we believe that alternative interpretations of the data may shed a different light on their conclusions. First, it is important to understand the patients included in this study. They began with a subset of patients (226/679 [33%]) treated in an adjuvant tamoxifen trial designed to compare the effects of tamoxifen (40 mg/day for 2 years) alone or with chemotherapy, and with or without radiation. Of these, only 112 patients received tamoxifen and only 71 were ER positive. Thus, only 10.5% of patients in the overall trial (71/679) were included in this small substudy, meaning that there is great potential for selection bias.Initially, the authors did not find a difference in outcome by CYP2D6*4 genotype, and therefore they compared the outcomes in patients with at least one CYP2D6*4 allele who received tamoxifen (n = 24) versus no tamoxifen (n = 23). They found that patients with the CYP2D6*4 genotype did significantly better than patients not treated with tamoxifen and observed a similar trend in women with the SULT1A1*1 homozygous genotype. They concluded that genotyping of these enzymes may be useful in predicting clinical outcomes and that their findings were in contrast to the current hypotheses on the role of metabolic enzymes in tamoxifen activation and inactivation.We believe the data presented are consistent with our results, which suggest that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may experience less benefit from tamoxifen treatment [2]. It is expected that ER-positive women treated with tamoxifen will have better outcomes than ER-positive women treated without tamoxifen, even if they have one CYP2D6*4 allele, because this group would not completely eliminate the benefits of tamoxifen. Indeed, it appears that the data presented by Wegman and coworkers are consistent with this hypothesis, albeit the numbers are very small because of the considerable subsetting and selection.Our studies have shown that the serum concentration of an active metabolite of tamoxifen, namely endoxifen, is effected by CYP2D6 status in a gene dose dependent manner, with low, intermediate and high concentrations in homozygous variant, heterozygous and homozygous wild-type patients, respectively [3,4]. Furthermore, data from a large randomized trial of postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years [2] indicate that women who are homozygous (but not heterozygous) for the CYP2D6*4 allele have significantly worse relapse-free survival and disease-free survivals than do women who are heterozygous or homozygous for the common allele. These findings suggest that the outcome of women with 'intermediate' concentrations of endoxifen, as represented by the heterozygous CYP2D6*4, are no different than women who carry two wild-type CYP2D6 alleles. This suggests that the clinical effect of tamoxifen is due to multiple metabolites, and only when women carry two null CYP2D6 alleles, corresponding to the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype, do outcomes deteriorate.Competing interestsThe authors(s) declare that they have no competing interests.",

        "body": "Since the early 1990s, the mortality rate associated with breast cancer has been declining in all industrialized nations. This continuing decline has been attributed to the implementation of more widespread breast cancer screening practices as well as advancements in systemic therapy, including chemotherapy and adjuvant hormonal therapy (Peto, Boreham, Clarke, Davies, & Beral, 2000).The concept of manipulating the female hormonal environment for the treatment of breast cancer dates back to the late 1800s. Several physicians at that time, including George Thomas Beatson, a Glasgow surgeon, disagreed with the prevailing theory of breast cancer as a parasitic disease. Beatson had been studying the castration of cattle for the purpose of prolonging lactation and hypothesized that manipulation of the hormonal system through oophorectomy in a premenopausal woman with advanced breast cancer might be of benefit. In an article originally published in The Lancet in 1896, Beatson reported the case studies of three young patients with advanced breast cancer who agreed to undergo bilateral oophorectomy. In his article, he described how two of the three women had remarkable decreases in their disease burden and increased palliation for some period of time following oophorectomy (Beatson, 1896).Hormonal ManipulationThe concept of hormonal manipulation continued to attract scientific interest. In the 1960s through the 1970s, tamoxifen, a drug that was initially evaluated (unsuccessfully) as a postcoital contraceptive medication, continued to be investigated and was found to improve progression-free survival in women with advanced breast cancer (Cole, Jones, & Todd, 1971). This led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of tamoxifen in the metastatic setting in 1977. In subsequent trials, tamoxifen was proven effective in the adjuvant treatment setting (Fisher et al., 1989).Tamoxifen acts as a competitor with estrogen for the binding site of the estrogen receptor within breast tissue. Tamoxifen became the first FDA-approved selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for the treatment of breast cancer. Today, it is utilized not only in the adjuvant and metastatic treatment settings, but it was also the first FDA-approved chemopreventive agent for those deemed at high risk for the development of breast cancer (Fisher et al., 1998).Questions of Optimal DurationThe question of optimal duration of adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, and more specifically tamoxifen, has been under ongoing investigation for decades. Many trials of varying durations of adjuvant tamoxifen were conducted. In 1998, a meta-analysis of adjuvant tamoxifen trials was reported by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). In the 55 clinical trials reviewed (consisting of about 30,000 women), with durations of 1, 2, and about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the proportional recurrence reductions produced during about 10 years of follow-up were 21% (standard deviation [SD] 3), 29% (SD 2), and 47% (SD 3), respectively (p < .00001). The corresponding proportional breast cancer mortality reductions were 12% (SD 3), 17% (SD 3), and 26% (SD 4), respectively (p = .003; EBCTCG, 1998).NSABP B-14 was one of the pivotal randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials looking at 5 years of tamoxifen vs placebo in operable, estrogen receptor–positive, lymph node–negative breast cancer patients. Through 10 years of follow-up, disease-free survival (DFS) was superior in the tamoxifen arm vs. the placebo arm: 69% vs. 57% (p < .0001). Distant DFS was 76% vs. 67%, respectively (p < .0001). Overall survival trended in favor of the treatment arm: 80% vs. 76% (p = .02).In 1987, an extension of B-14 commenced to investigate a longer duration of adjuvant tamoxifen. Patients on the tamoxifen arm of B-14 and disease-free at 5 years were reassigned to an additional 5 years of tamoxifen therapy vs. placebo. For patients on the placebo arm as compared with the tamoxifen arm, ongoing follow-up revealed an advantage beyond 5 years in terms of DFS, 92% vs. 86% (p = .003); distant DFS, 96% vs. 90% (p = .01); and overall survival, 96% vs. 94% (p = .08; Fisher et al., 1996). Therefore, the standard of care for the duration of adjuvant tamoxifen became 5 years of therapy.The ATLAS TrialDespite the findings of the extension portion of the B-14 trial, additional adjuvant tamoxifen duration trials continued. The ATLAS (Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter) study was an international trial, enrolling over 12,000 patients from 1996 to 2005 from 36 countries or regions.Study Design Eligibility criteria were having resectable disease that was completely excised, being currently on tamoxifen for 5 years, or having stopped tamoxifen within the past year and being able to easily resume therapy. Participants had to have no evidence of distant metastasis at the time of enrollment. 90% of the participants were postmenopausal women. The two treatment arms were the continuation of tamoxifen for an additional 5 years of therapy vs. placebo. No restrictions were placed on age, histology, hormone receptor status, nodal status, or other treatments (Davies et al., 2013).Outcomes Analysis Of those study patients initially enrolled, 6,846 were confirmed to have estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease and were included in the breast cancer–related outcomes analysis. In both study groups, 91% of survivors were still being followed 10 years after diagnosis, and 77% were still being followed 15 years after diagnosis. Comparing the tamoxifen arm with the placebo arm, the risk of recurrence in years 5 through 14 was 21.4% vs. 25.1%, respectively, and breast cancer–specific mortality was 12.2% vs. 15%, respectively, equating to an absolute breast cancer mortality reduction of 2.8%. It is important to note that longer follow-up was needed to ascertain the full benefits of extending tamoxifen treatment beyond 5 years. The reduction in the risk of breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer–related mortality was greater after year 10 following diagnosis, meeting statistical significance, and less so between years 5 and 9.In terms of compliance to the study arms at 2 years into enrollment in the ATLAS trial, 84% of those allocated to continue on tamoxifen were compliant compared with 96% of controls (4% of control patients had initiated adjuvant hormonal therapy, predominantly tamoxifen). The researchers surmised that with 100% compliance to therapy, the benefits of longer adjuvant tamoxifen would be even greater. The EBCTCG is expected to report a meta-analysis of longer-duration tamoxifen trials, including data not only from ATLAS but from the aTTom (Adjuvant Tamoxifen Treatment Offers More) trial and other smaller trials as well.Side Effects The most common side effects of tamoxifen therapy are postmenopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats; vaginal dryness, discharge, or irritation; and irregular menses. These toxicities can range from mild to severe, at times significantly affecting quality of life. These side effects were not discussed within the Davies et al. article, but they have been well described in previous tamoxifen trials (Day et al., 1999).In terms of life-threatening toxicities, the two most commonly seen with tamoxifen therapy are risk of a secondary endometrial cancer and increased risk of a thromboembolic event. For the analysis of adverse events within the ATLAS trial, all 12,894 enrolled study patients were included. The most noteworthy events included the increased risk of a pulmonary embolus, for which the event rate ratio (RR) was 1.87 (p = .01). In terms of a secondary endometrial cancer, the event rate ratio was 1.74 (p = .0002). The incidence of endometrial cancer was 3.1% in the tamoxifen arm vs. 1.6% in the placebo group. Endometrial cancer–related mortality was 0.4% in the tamoxifen arm vs. 0.2% in the placebo arm. Despite the increased risk of a thromboembolic event or a secondary endometrial cancer, the expected benefits of tamoxifen therapy in terms of reduction of breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer–related mortality outweighed the expected toxicities and potential negative outcomes.Compliance As noted earlier, the compliance rate for tamoxifen-randomized patients was around 84% at year 7 of tamoxifen therapy. This finding is not unexpected and is consistent with compliance rates noted in previously published adjuvant tamoxifen trials (Makubate, Donnan, Dewar, Thompson, & McCowan, 2013). The impact on quality of life in terms of toxicities such as postmenopausal symptoms is not to be underestimated. Concern about life-threatening adverse events such as thromboembolic events or secondary endometrial cancers has also kept patients from initiating and/or completing adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. If the absolute benefit in terms of decrease in breast cancer–related mortality of an additional 5 years of tamoxifen therapy is only 2.8%, a balanced discussion needs to occur weighing the benefits of therapy vs. the impact on quality of life and potential life-threatening toxicities.Other Antiestrogen TherapiesOther antiestrogen therapy options, such as aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and results from clinical trials in which patients switch from tamoxifen to an AI or vice versa with varying schedules and durations of therapy have confounded a clear path as to the optimal drug(s) and duration of adjuvant antiestrogen therapy.One pivotal trial in this arena was the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial, which provided data in favor of an AI vs. tamoxifen taken for 5 years (Cuzick et al., 2010). The AI anastrozole was found to be superior to tamoxifen in terms of improving DFS in postmenopausal women (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval = 0.78–0.95; p = .003).MA.17 was a clinical trial that randomized postmenopausal women to 5 years of letrozole therapy vs. placebo following 5 years of tamoxifen therapy (Goss et al., 2005). With a median follow-up of 30 months, women on letrozole saw improvement in terms of DFS compared to placebo (HR, 0.58; p < .001). There is now an extension portion of MA.17 randomizing those on the letrozole arm of MA.17 to an additional 5 years of therapy vs. placebo. The results of the extension portion of MA.17 are not yet known.In 2010, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) updated its adjuvant breast cancer guideline to recommend that all postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer use an AI either alone or before or after tamoxifen to reduce their risk of recurrence. The guideline updates went on to say that women may also use AIs for extended periods, after 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, to lower their risk of recurrence (Burstein et al., 2010).ConclusionFor postmenopausal women, the decision to initiate tamoxifen or AI therapy up front may be based on stage of disease, risk of recurrence, age, comorbidities, or personal choice. If tamoxifen is initially started, the ASCO guidelines recommend switching to an AI at some time point during the course of antiestrogen therapy. For premenopausal women, tamoxifen, now in a duration of 10 years, may provide a viable option to further decrease the risk of breast cancer recurrence. The expectation is that more clinical trials and longer follow-up will continue to guide clinicians regarding the optimal therapy and duration of adjuvant antiestrogen therapy.",

        "body": "The Oxford Overview of adjuvant endocrine trials [1] indicates that 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces recurrence by 41% and deaths by 34% in women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. At 5 years, in all patients studied, the recurrence rate was 25.8% in controls but 13.9% on tamoxifen. There was a substantial 'carry over' effect of tamoxifen such that even after 15 years of follow up mortality was about 30% less in tamoxifen-treated patients. The effect of tamoxifen was greater in patients with ER-positive, PR-positive as compared with ER-positive PR-negative tumours. These data indicate a substantial effect of tamoxifen but it is clear that approximately half of patients are resistant to tamoxifen de novo (early relapses) or acquire resistance if we assume that women who relapsed later had an initial response to tamoxifen. The potential reasons for resistance include activated growth factor pathways overriding the inhibitory effects of the drug either via nuclear or membrane ER. Of ER-positive PR-negative tumours, 30% are HER1/2-positive, as compared with about 10% of ER-positive PR-positive tumours, and this difference may account for their lower activity of tamoxifen in PR-negative tumours. Modern aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are more effective in reducing relapse compared with tamoxifen whether AI treatment is initiated after surgery (ATAC and BIG1-98 trials) or after 2–3 years of tamoxifen (ITA, ARNO/ABCSG). At present, it is difficult to distinguish any differences in effectiveness between the three agents used in these trials (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) but small differences in toxicity patterns are beginning to emerge. The reason for the greater effectiveness of AIs is not clear. In randomized studies of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy [2] and in the anastrozole adjuvant trials (ATAC and ARNO/ABCSG) [3], the AIs used were particularly more active than tamoxifen in the ER-positive PR-negative subgroup of tumours, but this was not seen in the BIG1-98 and IES trials. Studies on letrozole resistant human mammary tumour cell lines show that growth factor pathways such as MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) are activated, and sensitivity to the AI can be restored by growth factor pathway inhibitors [4]. Also, AI resistance can be reduced by combined treatment with fulvestrant in animal models. These data suggest mechanisms whereby AI resistance may be circumvented in patients and point to new approaches to adjuvant treatment.",

        "body": "IntroductionTamoxifen is an antiestrogenic drug used frequently as a coadjutant treatment in breast cancer. Ocular complications of tamoxifen are rare and include vortex keratopathy, bilateral crystalline maculopathy, macular edema and optic neuritis [1, 2, 3, 4]. We report a patient who developed bilateral macular edema without crystalline deposits while receiving tamoxifen. Maculopathy secondary to tamoxifen therapy was considered.Case ReportA 41-year-old female patient was referred to our department for progressive bilateral visual loss over the last 2 months. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had undergone a radical mastectomy 6 years ago. Since then, she had been receiving tamoxifen at a dosage of 20 mg/day.On examination, the Snellen best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in her right eye (OD) was 3/10 and that in her left eye (OS) was 2/10. Intraocular pressure was normal and anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed severe bilateral macular edema. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed bilateral, intraretinal macular edema with a central macular thickness of 506 μm in her OD and of 469 μm in her OS, respectively (fig. 1). Fluorescein angiography showed late-phase diffuse hyperfluorescence corresponding to the edematous area in both eyes (fig. 2). A diagnosis of central serous retinopathy was excluded because fluorescein angiography revealed no leakage point from the choroid in early phases. Furthermore, no pigment epithelium detachment was detected.Due to a history of tamoxifen administration for 6 years and absence of other pathologies causing macular edema, maculopathy secondary to tamoxifen therapy was considered. Tamoxifen therapy was discontinued. Instead of tamoxifen, the patient was administered 1 mg anastrozole daily which is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. The patient received 250 mg of acetazolamide three times a day and nepafenac drops three times a day to both eyes for a period of 1 month.Shortly after this, the central macular thickness started to diminish with both foveae regaining their normal contour within 2 months (fig. 3). Subsequently, her vision was restored to 10/10 BCVA 3 months later.DiscussionTamoxifen-induced retinopathy is a rare complication. The incidence among patients receiving tamoxifen is 0.6% and can increase up to 10.9% with the use of chemotherapy. The first case of tamoxifen-induced retinopathy was first described by Kaiser-Kupfer and Lippman in 1978 (it was about a woman who received extremely high doses of tamoxifen due to metastatic breast cancer) [1]. Since then, a number of studies have suggested that the use of low doses (20–40 mg/day) may be associated with a decrease in visual acuity and tamoxifen-induced retinopathy.There are two types of tamoxifen-induced retinopathy. One of them is an acute form, which manifests as diminished vision, retinal edema, retinal hemorrhage and optic disk swelling. This form may be due to the estrogenic activity of tamoxifen and is reversible after the discontinuation of the drug [5]. Selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen interact with two kinds of estrogenic receptors (ERs) referred to as α and β. The ratio of ERα and ERβ to a tissue is associated with the function of selective estrogen receptor modulators as estrogenic or antiestrogenic [6].After a long-term use of the drug, typical tamoxifen-induced retinopathy is characterized by the presence of crystalline maculopathy, which consists of refractive intraretinal crystalline deposits, especially in the perifoveal area that histologically may represent the products of axonal degeneration [2]. This damage might explain the associated visual loss caused by this type of retinopathy that may not reverse when tamoxifen is discontinued. Tamoxifen maculopathy is also often associated with macular edema, which is an accumulation of intraretinal fluid that subsequently decreases visual acuity.More recent studies with 3D-OCT reveal intraretinal cysts, even in patients with no visual symptoms and normal fundoscopy. Therefore 3D-OCT screening is recommended for all patients treated with tamoxifen [3, 4, 7, 8].In our case, discontinuation of the drug improved vision. We also administer oral acetazolamide and nepafenac eyedrops. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors increase fluid transport across the retinal pigment epithelium by inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. They are effective in cystoid macular edema and may also be effective in other types of macular edema. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as nepafenac inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is required for the production of the prostaglandins and may be beneficial in managing retinal edema [9].In our case, there were severe bilateral intraretinal edemas documented by OCT without the presence of crystalline retinopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported, where bilateral intraretinal macular edema is the only retinal manifestation in a patient on oral tamoxifen.ConclusionBilateral macular edema can be a manifestation of tamoxifen-induced retinopathy without the presence of typical crystalline deposits. Patients under tamoxifen treatment must periodically be examined by ophthalmologists for the early detection of tamoxifen-induced retinopathy and discontinuation of tamoxifen treatment if needed.Disclosure StatementThe authors have not received grant support or research funding, and they do not have any proprietary interests in the material described in the article.",

        "body": "Over 80% of primary breast cancers in postmenopausal women present as ER+. It is clear that aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are more effective than tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy for such patients. Overview analysis indicates that this proportional enhancement in benefit is seen across all common clinical subgroups [1]. Recent data from the BIG1-98 trial [2] revealed that initial therapy with tamoxifen with a switch after 2 years to letrozole was not as effective as continued letrozole, an important refutation of earlier modelling that suggested the sequential approach might be at least as effective as 5 years' AI treatment. The indication that 2 years of letrozole followed by 3 years of tamoxifen therapy is as effective as 5 years of letrozole provokes new thinking about the possible best use of these agents.Tamoxifen has some serious side effects (for example, increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism) that AIs do not, but the deleterious bone and joint effects of AIs make tamoxifen a continued choice of treatment in some patients, particularly those at low risk of relapse.The early indications that AIs might be relatively more effective than tamoxifen in PgR- versus PgR+ patients and HER2+ versus HER2- tumours have not been confirmed. Similarly, the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) showed similar relationships with risk of distant recurrence in both anastrozole and tamoxifen arms of the ATAC trial. Although data from BIG1-98 show a greater effect of AIs over tamoxifen at higher levels of Ki67, there is no significant interaction between the Ki67 and treatment effects – suggesting that this is largely an effect of high Ki67 being associated with poorer prognosis. There are conflicting data on whether polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene, which reduce the efficiency of conversion of tamoxifen to the more potent endoxifen, indicate a poorer efficacy for tamoxifen and therefore greater relative benefit from an AI.The decision to deliver adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to endocrine treatment is judged largely on the basis of prognosis after considering the impact of the endocrine therapy. While the RS is a validated instrument for this purpose, the prognostic effect of markers such as PgR, HER2 and Ki67 is substantial and may allow the development of widely applicable immunohistochemical approaches to risk evaluation.",

        "body": "Tamoxifen as an antioestrogenic drug was introduced in the seventies and is now widely used as adjuvant and palliative treatment in breast cancer patients. Tamoxifen use as adjuvant treatment prevents new breast cancers or delays disease progression. The drug blocks the binding of oestrogens to the human oestradiol receptors (ER), which are specific proteins in the human breast cell. Oestrogens have, by means of the ER, a proliferating effect on breast cancer cells. The presence of the receptor is a predictor of the endocrine responsiveness of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen (De Placido et al, 1990; Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), 1998; Chlebowski et al, 1999; Radmacher et al, 2000).In the EBCTCG overview of tamoxifen trials, recurrence reductions of 21, 28 and 50%, respectively, after 1, 2 and 5 years of tamoxifen treatment were found in ER-positive breast cancer patients after about 10 years of follow-up. Moreover, adjuvant tamoxifen has an effect on the prevention of contralateral breast cancer (CBC): by the EBCTCG, reductions of 13, 26 and 47%, respectively, were found after 1, 2 and 5 years of tamoxifen treatment (Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, 1998). These reductions did not depend on dose. Some data suggest that primarily ER-positive CBCs were reduced. In contralateral breast tumours, more often a negative ER status (47% in tamoxifen users vs 12% in nonusers) was observed after tamoxifen treatment, but the numbers were very small (Rutqvist etal, 1991). A randomised prevention trial comparing tamoxifen (20 mg daily for 5 years) with placebo in healthy women at high risk for breast cancer showed a reduction in the incidence of invasive breast cancer of approximately 50% through 69 months of follow-up (Fisher etal, 1998). In the tamoxifen arm, the occurrence of ER-positive tumours was decreased by 69%, but no difference (38 vs 31 breast cancers) was seen in the occurrence of ER-negative tumours. The ER+/ER− ratio was 1.07 in tamoxifen users vs 4.19 in nonusers. The recent results of the IBIS I trial are consistent with these results; here also no difference in absolute numbers of ER-negative tumours was seen (19 vs 19 breast cancers) (IBIS Investigators, 2002).It is therefore suggested that the benefit of tamoxifen in breast cancer treatment and prevention results from the growth inhibition of occult ER-positive tumours, and that tamoxifen is unlikely to prevent the progression of ER-poor tumours, which is said to be associated with a less favourable prognosis (Fisher et al, 1998). In relation to this, and because of other events that influence morbidity, it has been speculated that the preventive effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer mortality in healthy women might be limited.We examined these issues by comparing the ER status of CBCs between two groups of postmenopausal patients with bilateral breast cancer, who had and had not received adjuvant tamoxifen for their initial breast cancer. In addition, we examined survival in tamoxifen-treated and nontreated patients after the diagnosis of CBC.METHODSFor this study, we identified all postmenopausal patients treated for a primary operable invasive breast cancer between 1984 and 1995, who were diagnosed with a CBC at least 1 year later. Patients from two cohorts were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis (NKI/AvL) in Amsterdam and from the Comprehensive Cancer Centre South (CCCS), which includes patients from eight community hospitals in the southeast of the Netherlands. Follow-up closed in December 1999.In the study period, approximately 2850 operable postmenopausal women (or 51 years of age and older) were treated for a first primary breast cancer in the NKI/AvL; 1071 received adjuvant tamoxifen. In the hospitals covered by the CCCS, 2923 postmenopausal patients (all stages) were treated in this period; 807 of them received tamoxifen.At the NKI/AvL, node-positive and node-negative breast cancer patients were randomised in an adjuvant tamoxifen trial to receive tamoxifen 30 mg day−1 for 1 or 3 years. ER status was not an eligibility criterion. The standard treatment in the CCCS region was adjuvant tamoxifen at a daily dose of 20 mg. Initially, the use was restricted to patients with ER-positive tumours. In both cohorts, primary node-positive, ER-positive and ER-negative patients were increasingly treated with tamoxifen, 20 mg day−1 from 1988 onwards. Treatment for the CBC was only local and no systemic treatment was administered.The follow-up scheme as advised by the ASCO was the same for the ipsi- as for the contralateral tumour (American Society of Clinical Oncology, 1997).In total, we identified 150 patients with metachronous CBC: 35 tamoxifen-treated patients and 115 patients without previous tamoxifen treatment. Excluded were patients with ipsilateral local recurrence or distant disease at diagnosis of the CBC, because the differential diagnosis between second primary tumour or metastasis in the breast would be difficult in those patients. Patients with a contralateral ductal in situ cancer were included in the analysis, but not patients with lobular in situ carcinoma.The data of the original ER reports (mostly analysis by biochemical methods) were used for the primary breast cancers. The paraffin blocks of the CBCs were requested from the different hospitals for immunohistochemical receptor analysis. Paraffin blocks of 30 patients of the treated group and 98 of the nonusers group were available for receptor analysis (staining with DAKO, clone 1D5, 1 : 500). The ER status was considered positive in cancers with more than 10% nuclear staining.Medical records were reviewed for clinical data: age, date of diagnosis, stage and ER status of both ipsi- and contralateral tumour, interval between ipsi- and contralateral tumor, tamoxifen treatment with dose and treatment duration and follow-up status up to December 1999.Statistical methodsFor 2 × 2 tables P-values were calculated from Fisher's exact test. The comparison between ipsi- and contralateral breast cancers was done by the test of McNemar.The triple association between tamoxifen treatment and ER status of first and second tumour was investigated by using binary repeated measurements analysis. Survival curves were calculated using the method of Kaplan and Meier and compared by the log-rank test. For overall survival the event of interest was death from any cause, and for disease-specific survival death from breast cancer.The statistical package SAS 6, 12 – specifically the procedures TTEST, FREQ, CATMOD, GLM, and LIFETEST – was used for all analyses.RESULTSAmong the 150 patients with CBC, 35 (23%) had been treated with adjuvant tamoxifen; 22 from the NKI and 13 from the CCCS. The mean age at first breast cancer was 62.4±7.4 (s.d.) years (range 51 – 77), and the mean age at diagnosis of the CBC was 67.1±7.4 (s.d.) years (range 54–79). The mean age at first breast cancer and CBC did not differ between the tamoxifen- and the nontreated group (see Table 1Table 1Characteristics of first primary breast cancer in CBC – cases with and without previous tamoxifen treatment Tamoxifen usersTamoxifen nonusersCharacteristicsn=3523%n=11577%Mean age at diagnosis±s.d.62.4±7.4 year62.9±8.6 yearRange(51–77)(49–81)Pathological tumour size     pT1 (1–20 mm)9/3526%73/11563% pT2 (21–50 mm)20/3557%40/11535% pT3 (>50 mm)5/3514%2/1152%Pathological nodal status     pN06/3517%90/11578%ER statusa     Negative3/2910%12/7815% Unknownn=6 n=37 Family history: at least one first degree member15/3345%37/11034%BC=breast cancer; ER=oestrogen receptor.aER status from original test result, mostly biochemical. and Table 2Table 2Characteristics of CBCs in patients with and without previous tamoxifen treatment Tamoxifen usersTamoxifen nonusers  n=3523%n=11577%P-valueMean age at diagnosis±s.d.67.1±7.4 year67.1±8.9 year  Range(54 – 79)(51 – 88) Interval IBC – CBC      <2 years7/3520%19/11517%  2–5 years12/3534%44/11538%  >5 years16/3546%52/11545% Pathol. tumour size      pTis5/3415%7/1126%  pT1 (1–20 mm)20/3459%85/11278%0.33a pT2 (21–50 mm)5/3415%17/11216%  pT3 (>50 mm)4/3412%3/1123% Pathol. nodal status      pN019/3358%87/11377%0.045 pN114/3342%26/11323% ER statusb      Negative11/3037%18/9818%0.047 Positive19/3063%80/9882%  Unknownn=5 n=17  IBC=ipsilateral breast cancer; CBC=contralateral breast cancer; ER=oestrogen receptor;apTis+pT1 vs pT2+pT3.bImmunohistochemical test on paraffin blocks: ER negative ⩽10% of cells containing nuclear staining.). Of the 5773 patients treated in the two cohorts in the study period, 1878 (33%) received adjuvant tamoxifen. For the tamoxifen-treated patients, a crude CBC frequency of 1.9% was found and for the nonusers, a frequency of 3.0%.Since tamoxifen was prescribed to node-positive patients in particular, the stage of the primary breast tumour differed between both groups (\n Table 1). The tumour stage of the second breast cancer (Table 2) also only slightly differed between the tamoxifen-treated and the nontreated patients, with proportions of pTis+pT1 tumours of 74 and 82%, respectively, (Fisher's exact test P=0.33). For nodal stage, a difference between the groups was found: the proportion with pN1 was 42% for the treated and 23% for the nontreated group (P=0.045). Overall, relatively more small tumours were found as compared to the first breast cancer, (McNemar's test P<0.0001).Tamoxifen users appear to have more often ER-negative second breast cancers than nonusers: 37 vs 18% (P=0.047). Among the patients not treated with tamoxifen, the proportions of ER-negative tumours were quite similar for the first and the contralateral breast tumour: 15 and 18%. In the tamoxifen-treated group, however, 10% of the first primary tumours were ER negative, and 37% of the contralateral tumours (McNemar's test P=0.016). Therefore, a binary repeated measurement analysis was done, indicating an increase in the proportion of ER-negative tumours between the first and the CBC in tamoxifen-treated patients compared to patients without previous tamoxifen treatment (P=0.012). This analysis was carried out on 88 of the patients for whom ER status was known for both tumours.The difference between the tamoxifen users and nonusers regarding ER negativity of the second breast cancer seems to be especially large Q1in the late (>5 years) CBC group (P=0.005). However, this differential effect of interval may still be because of chance (interval tamoxifen interaction: P=0.091 in exact logistic regression).Figure 1Figure 1Overall survival curve. and Figure 2Figure 2Disease-specific survival curve. show the overall and disease-specific survival curves from the time of diagnosis of the second breast cancer, according to tamoxifen use for the first breast cancer. Six-year overall survival for nontreated patients was 70 vs 69% for tamoxifen-treated patients (P=0.45), and disease-specific survival was 88 vs 78%, respectively (P=0.14). Adjustment for stage did not change these results (Figure 3Figure 3Stage-adjusted survival curve.).DISCUSSIONIn this analysis of ER status in CBC patients, we found a greater proportion of ER-negative second cancers in tamoxifen-treated patients than in patients without tamoxifen treatment. The stage of these ER-negative CBCs was more often node positive, but this result did not seem to have a major impact on survival after the diagnosis and treatment of contralateral disease. This finding is in agreement with Rutqvist et al (1991) who Q2reported 47% of ER-negative CBCs during and after tamoxifen use vs 12% in nonusers. In the recent report of Li et al (2001) also an increase was found in ER-negative CBCs after tamoxifen use: 26 vs 4% in nonusers. Rutqvist et al (1991) did not find differences in tumour size or nodal status in the CBCs of tamoxifen-treated and non treated patients. In the present study, the proportion of early-stage CBC (stage 0+1) was slightly, but not significantly (P=0.33), lower in the tamoxifen-treated group (74%) compared to the nontreated group (82%); if a difference at all, sensitivity of mammography (NKI/AvL data not shown) cannot explain this, because sensitivity was 87% in both groups.BRCA 1 gene mutation carriers have been reported to develop ER-negative tumours more often (Loman et al, 1998). In the present study, no identified carriers were present among the tamoxifen users. Only one of three ER-negative patients of the tamoxifen-users group had a weak positive family history. In the nonusers group, two patients were known BRCA 1 mutation carriers; both had negative ER of first and second breast cancer. Thus the greater proportion of second ER-negative breast cancers cannot be explained by a difference in family history.Radmacher et al (2000) found more ER-negative tumours in the second and third year of the tamoxifen treatment. And Rutqvist et al (1991) found slightly more ER-negative tumours during tamoxifen treatment or within 3 months after cessation. In the present study, a significant time dependency for ER-negative tumours was not established, but a trend for more ER-negative CBCs was seen 5 years or more since the start of the tamoxifen treatment. This is somewhat paradoxical, assuming that ER-positive tumours, occult at diagnosis of the first breast cancer, are treated by tamoxifen, whereas the ER-negative tumours can grow. In the first 5 years after diagnosis of the first breast cancer, in both treatment groups 21% of ER-negative tumours is seen. But after these 5 years, a difference becomes apparent: of the CBCs in the nonusers, only 10% has a negative ER, whereas 44% of the CBCs in tamoxifen users has a negative ER. This could mean that tamoxifen not only cures but also prevents ER-positive CBCs. This apparent selection of ER-negative breast cancer after tamoxifen use is more surprising as Tarone etal (2002) established that the increase in the incidence of breast cancer after 50 years of age is largely because of an increase in ER-positive breast cancers, while the incidence of ER-negative cancers remains constant.No literature could be found with regard to molecular – biological mechanisms of second primary breast cancers after adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. A review of O'Regan and Jordan (2002) describes the known mechanisms of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) at a target site, but the proportions of ER coregulator proteins and the pathways have not yet been established. The SERM – ER complex can recruit coactivators and corepressors, and these complexes may modulate genes by different pathways.In the present analysis, 6-year overall survival after diagnosis of CBC was not different in tamoxifen users and nonusers. A difference in disease-specific survival at 6 years, 88% in nonusers vs 78% in tamoxifen users, did not reach statistical significance. Nor was the 6-year overall survival different for both groups after adjustment for the stage of the first tumour. A limitation of these analyses is, however, that the treated and nontreated groups were not totally comparable regarding other tumour characteristics.In conclusion, the presented results suggest that the CBCs developing after 1–3 years of use of adjuvant tamoxifen are more frequently ER negative, and node positive. This observation, however, does not seem to have a major impact on the overall survival.",

Tamoxifen is a non steroidal triphenylethylene that competitively antagonizes the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma[2-5]. The occurrence of granulosa cell tumors in patients with antecedent tamoxifen has been previously reported in two patients[6,7]. Although tamoxifen has anti-estrogenic properties, it is converted to several metabolites that can act as estrogen agonists [6]. We report the third case of granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with tamoxifen use for breast carcinoma.Case presentationA 47-year-old gravidia 3, para 3 women with chemotherapy induced menopause, had been diagnosed with stage III(T2 N2M0) infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast 5 years before the development of a bilateral granulosa cell tumor of the ovary. After Patey's mastectomy, patient has received 6 cycle of anthracycline based chemotherapy (AC 60 protocol: adriamycin at 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide at 600 mg/m2) and adjuvant radiotherapy at a cumulative dose of 50 Gy. The estrogen receptors were strongly positive and the patient received tamoxifen at a dose of 20 mg as single daily dose since January 2004. The tamoxifen was stopped after 5 years. In February 2009, one month after that the patient has stopped the tamoxifen therapy, a nodule in the left ovary was discovered during a laparoscopy for tubal ligation. A left oopherectomy was done, the pathological results showed a granulosa cell tumor. Following this a total hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, pelvic and peritoneal washings and multiple peritoneal biopsies were done. The histopathological analysis showed a granulosa cell tumor of the right ovary with capsular rupture in the left ovary, moderate nuclear atypia and mitotic activity ranged between 3 and 5 per ten high-power-fields. Histological evaluation of uterus showed a proliferative endometrial lining. The tumor was classified as stage Ic according to the FIGO classification. The case of our patient was discussed in the multidisciplinary meeting and it was decided to keep her on a close follow-up. Thirteen months after initial diagnosis of granulosa cell of the ovary, she is free of disease.DiscussionThe granulosa cell tumor is a relatively uncommon ovarian neoplasm accounting 1% to 2% of all ovarian tumors [1]. These lesions occur most frequently in menopausal or postmenopausal women and may be associated with symptoms of estrogen or progesterone secretion [1]. The relationship between this hormonal treatment and the occurrence of such an ovarian tumor is questionable, as so many patients worldwide receive tamoxifen therapy and only two previous cases has been reported in literature till date. It's probable that the association of granulosa cell tumor and the use of tamoxifen for breast cancer is just a random observation and there is no relationship between them.As mentioned earlier, the granulosa cell tumors in conjunction with tamoxifen administration for breast cancer have been reported in literature. The first case was reported in 1994 by Gherman et al [6] in a 52-year-old woman. This patient had liver dysfunction induced by tamoxifen. The authors suggested that the impaired hepatic metabolism of the tamoxifen may be responsible for the ovarian tumor in their patient with elevated liver transaminase levels. The second case was reported in 2002 by Arnould et al [7]; they described a case of metastases of a breast carcinoma to an adult granulosa cell tumor in a 63-year-old woman receiving tamoxifen therapy with a past history of breast carcinoma. No explanation was provided for the occurrence and that was only the second case in the literature despite that the tamoxifen being used by a large number of patients around the world with breast cancer. Tamoxifen is an anti-oestrogenic non-steroidal compound widely used for adjuvant therapy in breast cancer [8]. Its proven efficacy as a chemotherapeutic agent has led to its prophylactic use in the prevention of breast cancer in healthy women at high risk of developing breast cancer and it has also shown efficacy in this regard [9]. Despite these anticarcinogenic properties, tamoxifen is also a carcinogen. Women, who take tamoxifen, whether therapeutically or prophylactically, are at significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer [9-11]. Tamoxifen is also a potent liver carcinogen in male and female rats [12], and induces uterine tumors when administered to neonatal [13] and adult rats [14,15]. These findings suggest an appropriate surveillance of these patients treated with tamoxifen in order to proceed to an early diagnosis of secondary gynecological cancers.Tamoxifen is subject to extensive hepatic metabolism. Not surprisingly, several of the metabolites are predominately estrogenic, rather than antiestrogenic. Differences in tamoxifen metabolism among mice, rats, and humans probably contribute to variation among species-agonist versus partial agonist properties [16].The metabolite E is generated by the catabolism of tamoxifen, which has a lower affinity for estrogen receptors than tamoxifen [17-19]. However the cis isomer of metabolite E (tamoxifen with a hydroxyl group in place of the dimethylaminoethane side chain) is a potent agonist that displays a high affinity for the estrogen receptor [5,20]. This metabolite has been isolated from dog bile, a species where tamoxifen is predominantly estrogenic. Wiebe et al have identified metabolite E and bisphenol in tamoxifen resistant MCF-7 human breast tumors implanted in athymic nude mice, as well as in tumors isolated from patients who have undergone unsuccessful tamoxifen therapy [21,22]. Tamoxifen is known to exhibit estrogenic effects in other animal species. Tucker et al were showed in the studies of tamoxifen oncogenicity an elevated of the incidence of granulosa cell tumors at 36% in two groups of female mice receiving 5 or 50 mg/kg of tamoxifen [23]. In their study on cultured rat granulosa cells, welsh et al proved that tamoxifen exerts an augmentative, dose-dependent estrogenic effect on FSH-stimulated aromatase activity and estrogen production. They demonstrated that tamoxifen compete with [3H] estradiol for binding to the ovarian estrogen receptors [24].Raloxifene and tamoxifen are Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) that have estrogen agonist activities on bone and serum lipid metabolism, and estrogen antagonist activities in mammary tissue in ovariectomized rats [25-27]. Treatment with raloxifene for 6 months resulted in disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, manifested by increased plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol-17b (E2), and failure of ovulation. Many (56% to 80%) rats in all raloxifene treated groups had focal, minimal to slight hyperplasia of granulosa cells within individual retained follicles. A few treated rats in the mid- and high-dose groups had more extensive focal proliferation of granulosa cells. The results of this study indicate that raloxifene administration to rats causes increases in granulosa cell hyperplasia [25].ConclusionsAssociation between granulosa cell of the ovary and antecedent use of tamoxifen is very rare. When compared to world wide tamoxifen use among women, it appears to be just a random appearance and tamoxifen use does not appear to increase the risk of granulosa cell tumor of the ovary.ConsentWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

        "body": "Adjuvant endocrine therapy is an integral component of care for endocrine-dependent breast cancer (EDBC). The goal of this type of therapy is to counteract the production and the action of estrogens. The ovary is the primary site of estrogen production in premenopausal women, whereas, in postmenopausal women, the main source of estrogens is adipose tissue. Therefore, ovarian function suppression [by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists] is an effective adjuvant strategy in premenopausal women with EDBC. Similarly, the inhibition of estrogen action at the receptor site by tamoxifen has proven to be effective (1).To date, international consensus statements recommend tamoxifen (20 mg/day) for five years as the standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women, while the role of LHRH agonists remains controversial and under active investigation (2–4). In particular, the value of the addition of ovarian suppression by LHRH agonists along with tamoxifen, particularly in chemotherapy-treated patients who may develop ovarian failure as a consequence of cytotoxic treatment, is not well-defined (2,4–7).It should be noted that tamoxifen is a potent inducer of ovarian function in premenopausal women (8). The evaluation of endocrine parameters in premenopausal women during treatment with tamoxifen as a single agent has demonstrated that the levels of estradiol, estrone and progesterone are elevated one- to three-fold (9). Therefore, the effect of numerous years of ovarian stimulation by tamoxifen must be evaluated, particularly in women with node-negative disease or in healthy women in whom tamoxifen is used to prevent breast cancer. Equally important is the effect that the hyperestrogenism induced by tamoxifen exerts at the endometrial level (10,11).In the present study, we report two cases of ovarian cyst formation and endometrial hyperplasia induced by tamoxifen used alone as adjuvant treatment for estrogen positive breast cancer in premenopausal women. This study demonstrated the requirement for the administration of LHRH agonist to effectively suppress the tamoxifen-induced estrogen hyperproduction by the ovaries. Patients provided written informed consent.Case reportsCase 1In January 2013, a 37-year-old woman was admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Sirai Hospital (Carbonia, Italy) with a diagnosis of bilateral ovarian cysts associated with endometrial hyperplasia and lower abdominal pain, with suspected ovarian malignancy. The patient reported amenorrhea and was willing to have a pregnancy.Two years previously, the patient had undergone conservative breast surgery for high-grade ductal carcinoma of the right breast [stage I; estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, 90%; progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive; 80%; human epidermal growth factor 2-negative; Ki67 labeling index, 10%]. Following surgery, the patient received breast irradiation and adjuvant tamoxifen therapy without an LHRH agonist. There was no history of ovarian enlargement prior to tamoxifen administration.During the periodic oncological follow-up examinations, a transvaginal sonogram demonstrated endometrial hyperplasia with a hyperechogenic heterogeneous endometrial pattern with a thickness of 15.5 mm (Fig. 1). Bilateral ovarian cysts were also observed, including a right multilocular ovarian cyst (85×40 mm) and a left multiloculated mass (65×46 mm). Color Doppler sonography showed partially vascularized intracystic septa (Fig. 2). No evidence of ascites was observed and tumor markers, cancer antigen (CA)-125, CA-15.3 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), were within the normal range.As the patient was undergoing tamoxifen treatment without ovarian suppression with a LHRH agonist, we hypothesized that ovarian hyperstimulation was present. Subsequently, the levels of serum estradiol were measured and identified to be 1,200 pg/ml. The patient was symptomatic with lower abdominal pain and, thus, laparoscopic bilateral ovarian cystectomy was performed. The extemporaneous histological examination revealed bilateral follicular ovarian cysts. A hysteroscopy with biopsy was also performed, and the histological examination showed a ‘simplex endometrial hyperplasia’. The postoperative course was without complications, and the patient was discharged two days later.Continuation of tamoxifen therapy plus the addition of an LHRH agonist was discussed with the patient, and the patient accepted. The pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound (US) examination three months later showed a regression of the endometrial hyperplasia (thickness, 7.6 mm). The patient has continued the adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen and an LHRH agonist, and the follow-up examinations of one year to February 2014 have been negative for breast cancer relapse. Transvaginal US evaluation over one year after surgery showed an endometrial thickness in the normal range (<8 mm), normal ovaries (left ovary, 33×17 mm in the largest sagittal diameter; right ovary, 24×10 mm in the perpendicular diameter) and estradiol levels (<20.00 pg/ml).Case 2In June 2013, a 33-year-old woman was admitted to the Department of Gynaecologic Oncology, A. Businco Hospital (Cagliari, Italy) with a diagnosis of left ovarian cysts and endometrial hyperplasia. Two years previously, the patient underwent radical mastectomy plus ipsilateral lymphadenectomy for a low grade papillary carcinoma of the right breast (stage I; ER-positive, 80%, PgR-positive, 80%; HER2-negative, Ki67 labeling index, 15%). Following surgery, adjuvant endocrine treatment with tamoxifen and an LHRH agonist was initiated.After 10 months, the patient chose to terminate the LHRH agonist treatment for self-reported side effects consisting of insomnia, irritability and arthralgia. The patient continued to receive 20 mg/day of tamoxifen alone. At the 12th month following LHRH interruption, during the planned periodic examinations, a transvaginal US showed a heterogeneous endometrial pattern (thickness, 14 mm) and the presence of a multilocular left ovarian cyst (54×44×40 mm). Color duplex sonography showed no increased vascularization. No evidence of ascites was observed and laboratory data indicated an elevated serum estradiol concentration of 698.80 pg/ml. Tumor markers (CA-125, CA-15.3 and CEA) were within the normal range.Continuation of tamoxifen therapy and the resumption of a LHRH analog were discussed with the patient, and the patient accepted. The pelvic and transvaginal US examination three months later showed an endometrial hyperechogenic pattern with a thickness of 7.6 mm, and normal ovaries (left, 20×15.9 mm in the largest sagittal diameter; right, 21×16 mm in the perpendicular diameter). The patient’s estradiol levels decreased to 22.14 pg/ml. The next follow-up assessments to February 2014 showed normal endometrial thickness, ovaries and estradiol levels; in addition, examinations for breast cancer recurrence were negative.DiscussionThe cases described in the present report demonstrated the presence of functional ovarian cysts with very high estrogen levels during the administration of tamoxifen alone as an adjuvant treatment for premenopausal EDBC. The patients also presented with biopsy-proven endometrial hyperplasia.A limited number of studies have reported cases of tamoxifen-induced ovarian cysts in breast cancer patients (8,12–17). These papers show that tamoxifen-induced ovarian cysts commonly occur after three months of tamoxifen treatment, with the highest incidence in the interval between three to 11 months after treatment initiation. Additionally, the development of ovarian cysts after two years of tamoxifen treatment is extremely rare.Tamoxifen therapy for five years is considered the standard endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with EDBC (18). However, data on the impact of tamoxifen on ovarian function are often lacking in the literature. As the ovary is the main source of estrogen in premenopausal women, the evaluation of ovarian function during tamoxifen treatment should represent a central issue in the management of EDBC in premenopausal women. It has been reported that during tamoxifen treatment, a percentage of premenopausal patients have increased ovarian function associated with elevated estradiol levels. In these patients, the amenorrhea, if present, may falsely suggest ovarian failure, masking the presence of hyperactive ovaries (19).Tamoxifen may increase plasma estrogen concentrations by interfering with normal negative pituitary feedback mechanisms, with a resulting increase in follicle-stimulating hormone-driven ovarian steroidogenesis (12). Subsequently, the development of ovarian cysts associated with high estradiol levels indicates the presence of hyperactive ovaries as a consequence of tamoxifen action. An additional mechanism involved in the increased estrogen production by tamoxifen is its direct effect on granulosa cells (20).It is still currently debated whether the ovarian stimulation induced by tamoxifen could theoretically interfere with its antitumoral effects in premenopausal EDBC. In this context, a high-priority research question is whether additional benefit is gained with the use of LHRH agonists in addition to tamoxifen or as an alternative (21). Two meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials assessing the role of LHRH agonists in the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal EDBC patients (22,23) demonstrated a clear benefit in terms of recurrence rate and disease-free survival from ovarian suppression with LHRH agonists, both in combination with tamoxifen and as a single intervention. Notably, when assessing the subgroup of patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy that is expected to induce a menopausal status, a significant benefit in terms of reduced recurrence rate and death has been observed only in very young premenopausal women (aged ≤40 years) (23). It is hypothesized that chemotherapy is less likely to induce permanent amenorrhea in this population of patients than in older women. This evidence may be even more significant in women receiving more modern based chemotherapy regimens, which induce less commonly permanent amenorrhea (24), and even more significant in premenopausal patients who are not candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy. In this context, noteworthy data have been presented by Mourits et al (8), who showed that in patients who remained premenopausal after standard dose chemotherapy, tamoxifen use was associated, despite amenorrhea, with the development of ovarian cysts associated with the high estradiol levels that were indicative of overactive ovaries.The findings of the present study suggested that, in addition to the concerns regarding the optimum endocrine adjuvant treatment for premenopausal breast cancer, the effect of tamoxifen on the endometrium should be carefully considered. Ovarian hyperstimulation, with increasing circulating estrogens, induced by tamoxifen in premenopausal patients, may significantly influence the occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia and the subsequent risk of endometrial cancer. Additionally, the direct proliferative effect of tamoxifen on the endometrium should be considered (11,25).Thus, in young premenopausal patients with estrogen-dependent breast cancer, ovarian suppression is an essential prerequisite for an adjuvant endocrine with tamoxifen. In this context, LHRH agonist treatment by suppressing effective ovarian function may lead to a hypoestrogenic status that may positively impact breast cancer prognosis (23) and prevent the effects of tamoxifen at the gynecological level (endometrial hyperplasia and ovarian cyst formation) (26). In the literature, the majority of reported tamoxifen-induced ovarian cysts disappeared following cessation of tamoxifen treatment (13). In addition, cotreatment with tamoxifen and an LHRH agonist resolved ovarian cysts (14–17). By contrast, expectant management without abandoning tamoxifen use may cause complications, such as torsion and cystic necrosis; in these latter cases, even if the ovarian enlargement is benign, the growth of cysts may require surgical intervention with an increased risk of morbidity.In conclusion, based on this evidence, it is important to reconsider the action of tamoxifen on ovarian function, and include these specific effects of tamoxifen on ovarian activity in the informed consent of premenopausal patients who are candidates for tamoxifen alone as adjuvant endocrine treatment.",

        "body": "Tamoxifen is an effective treatment in reducing recurrence and mortality rates for estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer patients 1. On the other hand, an undesirable side effect of increasing risk of endometrial cancer has been suspected for decades 2-6. A number of case-control studies showed that the risk of endometrial cancer increased after long-term tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer patients 2-6. A vast majority of these case-control studies were conducted in the western world with a small sample size (from a total of a few hundred to a few thousand cases in each study 2-6. The data of tamoxifen use from Asia countries were scarce. A previous study of 674 consecutive breast patients in Japan reported that tamoxifen use for longer than 5 years correlated with increasing risk of developing endometrial cancer, while the small sample size prevented to detect statistical significance 7.A more recent study analyzing pooled studies from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and National Library of Medicine for published data from January 1970 to December 2010, however, reported that “The risk of endometrial cancer, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is low in women <50 years who take tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention. The risk decreases from the active to follow-up phase of treatment 8. In addition, although levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) has been used in patients with breast patients taking tamoxifen (TAM) to prevent endometrial proliferation, the benefits, the side effects, and the patients suitable for this treatment are still elusive 9.The above facts clearly indicate the needs for further clarification of the potential link between Tamoxifen use and the risk for endometrial cancer. Since the incidences of breast and endometrial cancer have been increasing (Figure 1), according to the Taiwan cancer registration system (https://cris.bhp.doh.gov.tw/pagepub/Home.aspx), our study aimed to assess the endometrial cancer risk after tamoxifen adjuvant treatment for female breast cancer patients in Taiwan using a significantly large and population-based database.Materials and MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate tamoxifen use on endometrial cancer risk for breast cancer patients in Taiwan. In our study, the data included details of inpatient orders files, inpatient expenditures by admissions files, details of ambulatory care orders files and ambulatory care expenditures files. The above data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (http://www.nhri.org.tw/nhird/en/index.htm) provided by the Bureau of National Health Insurance, Department of Health, and managed by National Health Research Institutes. All identifiers of all patients were completely removed before the release of the documentation and the encrypted data used in our study cannot link to any of the specific individual.A total of 74,280 patients treated for breast cancer between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2004 were included in the study. The cases were identified according to the coding of Ninth Revision International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) 1740-1749 (malignant neoplasm of female breast). Of the 74,280 patients, 39,411 (53.1%) received tamoxifen treatment, and 34,869 (46.9 %) did not. The duration of tamoxifen treatment was timed from the first to the last prescription for tamoxifen. Tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer was defined as endometrial cancer that occurred in patients at least 6-month after the diagnosis of breast cancer, who underwent tamoxifen treatment.Descriptive statistics were used for patients' demographic characteristics analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the potential association between the development of endometrial cancer with tamoxifene treatment, prior hormone exposure, hypertension, diabetes and age. The SAS statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC. Version 9.1) was used to perform analysis. The statistical significance was adopted at p values of less than 0.05.ResultsA total of 222 patients developed endometrial cancer. The characteristics of these 222 patients are shown in Table 1. Of the 222 endometrial cancer cases, 153 (69 %) were seen in patients with tamoxifen treatment, and 69 (31%) were seen in patients without the use of tamoxifen. The incidence of endometrial cancer was 0.388% (153/39,411) in patients with tamoxifen treatment, while was 0.198% (69/34,869) in patients without tamoxifen treatment (p < 0.001).Among patients with tamoxifen treatment, the average duration of tamoxifen use was 2.91 years in patients developed endometrial cancer, and was 1.67 years in patients did not develop endometrial cancer (Table 2).Logistic regression of endometrial cancer risk for breast cancer patients on prior hormone exposure, hypertension, diabetes, age and tamoxifene treatment are shown in Table 3. Tamoxifen use and age over 35 years were significantly correlated with the development of endometrial cancer (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). Patients treated with tamoxifen had a significantly higher risk of endometrial cancer than those who did not take tamoxifen (OR 1.86; 95%CI, 1.40-2.47; p < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in prior hormone exposure, hypertension and diabetes.Logistic regression of endometrial cancer risk for breast cancer patients with tamoxifen use on duration of tamoxifen treatment, prior hormone exposure, hypertension, diabetes and age are shown in Table 4. A link between long-term tamoxifen use and increasing endometrial cancer risk by odds ratio was 2.94 (95%CI, 2.13-4.06) for 3 years or longer; the odds ratio was 4.08 (95%CI, 1.67-9.93) for women aged older than 35 years compared to those aged 35 or younger than 35 years for breast cancer patients with tamoxifen use. There were no significant differences in prior hormone exposure, hypertension and diabetes.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest population based study to further assess the potential association between tamoxifen use for breast cancer treatment and the risk for endometrial cancer. Our study reveals that tamoxifen use and age over 35 years were significantly correlated with the development of endometrial cancer for breast cancer patients. Furthermore, for breast cancer patients undergoing tamoxifen treatment, a link between long-term tamoxifen use and increasing endometrial cancer risk by odds ratio was 2.94 (95%CI, 2.13-4.06) for 3 years or longer; the odds ratio was 4.08 (95%CI, 1.67-9.93) for women aged older than 35 years compared to those aged 35 or younger than 35 years. There were no significant differences in prior hormone exposure, hypertension and diabetes.Our findings are largely in line with those of previous studies. A case-control study revealed a significantly increasing endometrial cancer risk by OR 3.6 (95% CI; 2.6 to 4.8) for breast cancer women with tamoxifen treatment beyond five years compared those women with no treatment 4. The Comprehensive Cancer Centres' ALERT Group detected an increasing endometrial cancer risk for longer duration of tamoxifen use, relative risk 6.9 (95%CI, 2.4-19.4) for at least 5 years and 2.0 (95%CI, 1.2-3.2) for 2-5 years compared with non-users in breast cancer women 6.Our study has also obtained several unique findings that are not sufficiently addressed in previous studies, such the duration of tamoxifen use and patients' age. Previous studies showed an increasing endometrial cancer risk after 5-year tamoxifen use 4, 6, while our study reveals the risk impact can occur fewer than 3-years. Our study has suggested that age is an important factor for the development of endometrial cancer in breast cancer patients. In our study, an increasing endometrial cancer risk by OR 4.16 (95% CI = 1.71 to 10.14) was observed in the breast cancer women aged older than 35 years compared with the younger breast cancer patients (Table 3). Our study has also detected an increasing endometrial cancer risk by OR 4.08 (95% CI = 1.67 to 9.93) in breast cancer patients with tamoxifen treatment for women older than 35 years compared with the younger ones (Table 4).It is very important to prevent endometrial cancer developing or diagnose at early stage as tamoxifen is commonly used for all stages of hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients. A previous study reported that the endometrium thickness cumulatively increased during the tamoxifen treatment and the thicker endometrium remained years after the end of treatment, which results in increasing endometrial cancer development 10. Another study showed that breast cancer patients with tamoxifen use have early stage endometrial cancer and good prognoses 11. The incidence of subsequent endometrial carcinoma does not increase for primary breast cancer patients with tamoxifen usage if the patients underwent annual screening for gynecologic malignancies, including a pelvic examination, cervix and endometrium examination 12. Regular follow-up of the endometrium thickness in breast cancer women taking tamoxifen may play an important role for endometrial carcinoma early diagnosis 10.The risk of endometrial cancer has been traditionally reported for postmenopausal women receiving long term tamoxifen therapy. However, more than half of patients in this study appear to have developed cancer within 3 years, almost a third within 18 months. It was different from the western countries. The incidence peak of Taiwanese female breast cancer is also different form the western countries 13. The clinical implications need more studies for evaluating the pathogenesis, environmental genetics and other factors.ConclusionsOur study shows that tamoxifen use and age over 35 years significantly correlated with breast cancer patients with endometrial cancer. An increased awareness among gynecologic health provider may help early diagnose endometrial cancer. Regular gynecologic follow-up may be mandatory for those women with three years or above of tamoxifen use and age over 35 years.",
